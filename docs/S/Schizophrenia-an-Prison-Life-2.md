## Overview of Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a major disorder that is identifiable via constant episodes of psychosis, a break with reality. It is a disorder that heavily affects the individuals’ perception of reality, capacity to think clearly, severely affecting the ability to feel and behave appropriately as well. Schizophrenia is classified as a psychotic disorder within the DSM, and other disorders, specifically Bipolar type 1 can be mistaken for Schizophrenia due to the similarities of psychosis symptoms. However, the two mental disorders are different from each other regardless.

In order for an individual to be diagnosed with Schizophrenia, they must first meet the criteria as stated in the DSM (Ciccarelli, et. al 2014). The individual must exhibit two, or more symptoms over a course of one month and those symptoms must be present during that time as well to be considered for a diagnosis of Schizophrenia (Ciccarelli, et. al 2014). Delusions, hallucinations are two of the symptoms that are more commonly presented in schizophrenia. Disorganized speech, which are abnormalities that can make verbal communication difficult to comprehend is present as well. For example, their words may sound like ‘gibberish'. They may speak in an unclear manner, say random things that are unrelated in a conversation topic, spout illogical topics, or change from one subject to another rapidly. (Ciccarelli, et. al 2014). The fourth symptom of Schizophrenia is disorganized and catatonic behavior. For example: generally unpredictable or inappropriate emotional responses, poor control of impulsive behaviors along with a steep decrease in daily functioning. Normal daily routines, such as bathing and other simple self care, are abandoned. 

Negative symptoms such as reduced emotional expression and avolition are present as well. Avolition is generally the lack of motivation or capacity to complete tasks that have a time limit (examples can range from school assignments to paying bills to a work project deadline to name just a few). Avolition can not only be found in individuals with Schizophrenia but also individuals that have depression or even Bipolar disorder as well.
