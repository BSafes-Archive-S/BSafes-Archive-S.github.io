## The Exploitative Model—The Parasitic Model
In the exploitative model the proxy is dependent on the principal for survival. A parasite and a host are a useful mental model to visual when pondering the exploitative model. In this situation, the principal serves as the host, while the proxy serves as the parasite—it would not survive without being able to leech off the host. Yet, paradoxically, the proxy provides value to the principal in this arrangement, and therefore, the principal will do what it must to ensure its proxy’s survival. This reliance creates a strong bond between the proxy and the partner, resulting in the partner possessing near boundless power and influence over the proxy. Russia’s support for its Ukrainian proxy during the Russo-Ukrainian War (2014-present) is a useful example to demonstrate this point. During several critical battles, to include Ilovaisk, Second Donetsk Airport, and Debal’tseve, Russian land forces came to the relief of their overwhelmed and outmatched proxies during the Donbas Campaign. <sup>19</sup>

This model tends to be the result of a strong actor looking to outsource tactical combat operations, for a variety of reasons, to a weaker actor. As a result, the newly acquired proxy is only useful to the principal insofar as its ability to accomplish the principal’s objectives. Resultantly, exploitative proxy dyads are temporary—once the principal’s ends have been achieved, or the proxy is unable to maintain momentum towards the principal’s ends then the principal tends to discontinue the relationship.

Additionally, if the principal assesses that is proxy is gaining too much strength or independence, the principal will often eradicate political, strategic, or influential proxy leaders to maintain its primacy within the relationship. Theorist Colmar von der Goltz contends that, “The assailant also incurs the danger of losing allies who are willing to support him up to a certain point, but do not wish to see him grown strong at their expense.”<sup>20</sup> The dubious assassinations of the Donetsk People’s Republic’s Prime Minister Alexander Zakharchenko in August 2018 and acclaimed military commanders Mikhail Tolstykh in February 2017 and Arseny Pavlov in October 2016 fall into this category.<sup>21</sup> Open-source reporting makes attribution challenging to identify, but many sources contend that Zakharchenko, Tolstykh, and Pavlov were assassinated by Russian agents to neutralize their growing power and notoriety and to keep their Donbas proxies weak and compliant to Moscow.<sup>22</sup>

The United States has a similar, yet less violent relationship with its counter-ISIS proxy in Syria. The United States military manufactured the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) from a mixed bag of Syrian Kurdish militias, to include the People’s Protection Units, or YPG.<sup>23</sup> As the result of early success in the deserts and cities in eastern and northern Syria, the SDF branched out and established a political wing—the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC)— to advance its political agenda. <sup>24</sup> Kurdish self-rule in Syria’s Western Kurdistan region, also known as Rojava, is the primary goal of the SDF-SDC pact. <sup>25</sup>

Yet, Kurdish self-rule, as also seen in Iraq, presents a unique problem for principal actors locked in formal politico-military alliances such as NATO. Kurdish independence and self-rule are a major point of contention for Turkey, a US NATO ally. Turkey formally objected to the SDF and SDC’s growing power and influence in Syria and expressed this objection militarily. Since 2018, Turkey has conducted many military operations, to include Operation Olive Branch, to undercut the SDF-SDC’s growing political and military strength in Syria. <sup>26</sup> Turkey’s voracious objections in northern Syrian Kurdish territory and Rojava have derailed ongoing USSDF military operations on several occasions, resulting in strategic and operational pauses in the US-SDF campaign to defeat ISIS. <sup>27</sup> As a formal alliance member with Turkey, the US stood by and watched its proxy take a thrashing as it battled to protect its homeland from the Turks.<sup>28</sup> As a result of the battles with Turkey, the SDF has been beaten into a shell of the 60,000-man proxy force that it once was. <sup>29</sup> It is also important to note that exploitative proxies, which are often various groups brigaded together by a stronger actor to achieve a common objective, are challenged to remain unified as they approach mission accomplishment. The SDF in Syria, as but one example, experienced this unraveling as the group’s impetus, defeating the Islamic State, slowly recedes into the background. <sup>30</sup>

To close the discussion on exploitative proxy relationships, it is important to underscore that proxy success can change the relationship between the principal and the proxy. Successful proxies that can avoid punitive principals can generate sufficient legitimacy to outgrow is subservient relationship with its principal. Battlefield success and political moves can set dependent, exploited proxies free. Conversely, if a principal anticipates an exploitative proxy as a more useful tool in a more independent status, it might elect to allow that actor to gain more political power and independence.
