## Conclusion
The cases of Estonia, Georgia, and Ukraine highlight the role of offensive cyber operations in contemporary competition and conflict between states. Given the global nature of the domain, few if any states can prudently ignore the need to cultivate cyber security and resilience. Nor can states simply focus on cyber threats emanating from neighbors or the immediate region. State actors and cybercriminals have global reach. The precise institutional configuration of cyber responsibilities in a state will depend on contingent factors, such as the historical development of sovereign cyber capabilities (whether in the military or civilian intelligence agencies), and the extent to which armed forces have adopted domestic security missions as part of national defence. Whatever the impact of contingency and national specificity, however, some uniform observations are possible.

National strategic decision makers must recognize that military actions in traditional domains now occur increasingly in conjunction with different levels of cyber operations. What happened in Georgia in 2008 and to a greater extent in Ukraine from 2014-onward demonstrates the evolution of cyber operations, as a tool of statecraft and as a military instrument, complementing operations in other domains. The task of contemporary national defence must involve the security and resilience of digital infrastructure. This requires a coherently managed, strategic approach to cooperation between defence, law enforcement and the management of critical infrastructure. The resilience of the digital homeland is now an integral component of national defence. In early 2022, at the beginning of the most recent phase of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, cyber operations appear to have played a less prominent role in wider Russian strategy than might have been anticipated. It is too soon to assess at time of writing (early March) what factors most accounted for this: improved Ukrainian cyber defences; assistance by foreign state and corporate actors; intentional Russian planning that placed lower emphasis on the supporting role of cyber operations; or another contingency that undermined the alignment between cyber and wider operations. Far from undermining the argument that digital resilience is an integral element in national strategy, this latest cyber element of the conflict arguably reinforces the case for states to pursue broad efforts to improve national cyber defences.<sup>48</sup>

The grey zone of uncertainty—however implausible the deniability— exploited by cyber operations requires a national response that transcends improvements in the security of digital targets. States must consider how to reduce uncertainty by increasing national capabilities in cyber forensics. This should not be construed narrowly to refer simply to the creation of a national cyber defence or security center, but broadly to encompass different elements of national power and the role they play in enhancing national cyber forensic capabilities. This list should include: Efforts to build private sector capabilities in cyber security; structured and targeted state intervention in national education to ensure a future pipeline of suitably qualified cyber professionals; and reviewing the contribution of the collection and analysis capabilities of national intelligence agencies to the process of cyber investigation and attribution analysis.

Third, in the same way that national cyber strategy is not solely governmental and involves the crucial contribution of the private sector and wider society in upholding high standards of cyber security, so too does it transcend the domestic to include international and multilateral dimensions. <sup>49</sup> A state’s international relations are a major determining factor in identifying its likely cyber adversaries. Recent efforts by Ukraine’s and Georgia’s allies to publicly attribute cyber operations to Russia are examples of diplomatic solidarity through coordinated public attribution, although the strategy of public attribution is difficult to implement successfully.<sup>50</sup>

Recognition of the need for multi-domain operations is clearly part of a state’s response to the rising salience of cyber operations, as is heightened awareness of and response to the cyber risk to defence platforms, command and control and communications infrastructure. Another dimension of the cyber defence conundrum is the issue of the national requirement for an offensive cyber capability. Again, this question is inseparable from questions about the extent to which states can rely on private sector and foreign governmental partners to help to grow its sovereign cyber industrial base. Just as deficiency in national cyber investigation and attribution analysis leaves states reliant on the public good of analyses shared by other states or the services provided by leading cyber security companies, perceived deficiency in a state’s ability to respond symmetrically to a cyber operation might reduce the credibility of its overall deterrence strategy, or force it to rely disproportionately on other means. Offensive cyber capabilities should, therefore, increasingly feature in states’ national cyber defence strategies.

The above is by no means exhaustive and is necessarily brief as a summary of possible institutional and strategic reforms open to many states in their approach to the problems of cyber uncertainty. Given cyberspace’s ubiquity, states need a cyber strategy that encompasses coherently the overlapping issues of cyber defence, cyber security, resilience, and offensive cyber. Most importantly, such a strategic approach should recognize the shaping effects exerted on national cyber strategy by a state’s wider national security strategy and foreign policy posture. Cyber operations are only one dimension of a challenge that transcends any one military domain, institutional division within government, boundaries between public and private sectors, and indeed between national governments.
