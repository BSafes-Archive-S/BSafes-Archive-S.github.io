## Conclusions
While there is much on the topic of incarcerated individuals with Schizophrenia, there are still limitations on sample sizes and populations. Gender, age, and race are other factors as well that should be taken more into consideration as well. The population sample that the authors mentioned consisted only of African American males who had not yet completed high school (Ramsey, 2011). Future studies should include women with schizophrenia, those of different racial identities too, as there could be cultural differences towards those individuals as well. If more studies were done to expand on this disorder in this particular environment, there would be more of an understanding and education involving this disorder than how the media portrays the incarnated individuals with schizophrenia.
