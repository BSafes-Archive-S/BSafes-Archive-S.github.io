## Abstract
Students continue to face an increase in mental health concerns related to their role of being college students, including increased academic expectations; organizational and time management demands; and, often, a transition to an independent living situation. Mental health symptoms, such as stress and anxiety, have negatively affected students’ academic performance more than any other factors in college students’ lives, and nontraditional inexpensive interventions that can reach a large number of students, such as animal assisted intervention, continue to be explored. Thus, the researchers in this study investigated the effects of canine assisted education (CAE) on students’ stress and anxiety, distractibility, and participation in the natural environment of a college classroom. A quantitative quasi-experimental, one-group pre-test/post-test design was implemented in which participants completed a pre-test survey, experienced 5 weeks of CAE, and then completed a post-test survey. Wilcoxon signed-rank analysis revealed a significant effect for stress and anxiety (*p* = .033) and participation (*p* =.009). Findings add to the body of literature attesting to the efficacy of CAE in support student well-being and optimizing learning conditions for students.

Mental health is defined by the World Health Organization as “a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community” (2020, para 2). The term mental health has become a buzzword across university and college campuses nationwide as increasing numbers of students are being met with social-emotional challenges affecting academic performance and student roles both inside and outside of the classroom. Historically, student stressors include time management, academic expectations, and new social roles (Kitzrow, 2003). Many of the aforementioned historical stressors still remain in effect for current college students and are confounded by additional stressors. Some of these stressors (Ebert et al., 2019), like financial stressors, such as student debt and employment concerns (Brown, 2018), and overwhelming stimuli from technology, such as smart phones, social media, and cyber-bullying, include less individualized support from student services (Brown, 2018). In addition, although many causes for stress have been listed, researchers have stated the reasons for increased negative mental health symptoms vary significantly across demographic and social factors and still need to be studied (Hunt & Eisenberg, 2010).

Although the causes are still being researched, the drastic increase in mental health symptoms is well documented. According to the American College Health Association’s (ACHA, 2019) National College Health Assessment (NCHA), students reported being formally diagnosed with anxiety (24.3%), ADHD (6.7%), depression (20.0%), and panic attacks (11.9%), highlighting the need for increasing mental health services on college campuses as the percentages rise. The majority of mental health interventions on college campuses focus on 1:1 and group counseling services. Although the need for services has increased, there has not been an increase in funding or staff (Mowbray et al., 2006). Furthermore, there has been a perceived stigma associated with receiving counseling, particularly in health professional students, which may make counseling services less desirable to this student population and leave many health professional students with unmet needs (Gaddis et al., 2018).

Animal assisted interventions (AAIs) are increasingly researched and present a viable option as animals have been found to promote both mental and physical health benefits at a lower cost (Binfet & Passmore, 2016; Binfet & Stuik, 2018; Kamioka et al., 2014). AAIs purposefully include animals in health, education, or human services to achieve therapeutic gains in humans (International Association of Human-Animal Interaction Organizations, 2018). Current AAI research has focused on the effects of single event exposures and their impact on well-being, stress, and anxiety among college students (Barker et al., 2016; Binfet, 2017; Grajfoner et al., 2017; Pendry & Vandagriff, 2019). Although college campuses are experiencing increasing needs for mental health interventions, significant gaps exist in studying recurring AAI effects as well as exploring the role of AAIs in college classrooms.
