## Therapy Dog Impact on Anxiety and Stress, Distractibility, and Participation
Research related to therapy dog intervention demonstrates a reduction in anxiety and stress among college students through intervention in the classroom and through campus wide single events (Binfet, 2017). In the college setting, therapy dogs are most commonly used in counseling centers and through campus outreach events (Barker et al., 2016; Binfet, 2017). Most studies have focused specifically on using therapy dog intervention during midterm and final exams. Barker and colleagues (2016) identified the need for studying the effect of therapy dogs’ presence on stress during the completion of final exams. In another study, Pendry, Kuzara, and Gee (2019) supported the idea of dogs in the classroom to decrease stress in the moment, which allowed students to focus on materials being presented. There have been short-term positive effects demonstrated with the use of therapy dogs; however, little research has been conducted on studying the effects of recurring therapy dog intervention. The current study intends to investigate the recurring presence of a therapy dog in a classroom environment through CAE.

Individuals have experienced physical and mental benefits in regard to emotional development and social well-being as a result of exposure to animals. Researchers have documented decreased blood pressure, indicating individuals experienced decreases in stress as a result of exposure to therapy dogs (Jarolmen & Patel, 2018; McDonald et al., 2017). Jarolmen and Patel (2018) examined anxiety through blood pressure measurements before and after a 15-min interaction with a therapy dog on the day of a college exam. They found statistical significance, suggesting that exposure to therapy dogs had positive effects on reducing perceived anxiety of college students on exam days. Frequently, research surrounding the use of therapy dogs in college settings involves direct stimulation and interaction with therapy dogs, but few studied the effect of the mere presence of a therapy dog. Similarly, most research on this subject entailed single events or short exposure to animals. Binfet (2017) studied recurring sessions and found perceived stress and homesickness among college students decreased immediately after therapy dog exposure; however, the effects were not found to be sustained 2 weeks later. This suggests the need for future studies to explore recurring sessions and long-term effects of therapy dogs on college students to determine the efficacy of this intervention in battling mental health concerns.

Anxiety and stress are areas frequently highlighted and studied among AAI research. Pendry et al. (2019) studied the effect of therapy dogs on undergraduate students’ satisfaction with their program and participation levels in a classroom setting. This study compared the students’ responses to evidencedbased stress management lecture content, guided therapy dog interventions, and a combination of the two. Pendry et al. stated that therapy dogs had a positive impact on students presented with a combination of both coursework and interaction with therapy dogs, reporting that 14.9% of students felt more motivated to attend and participate when exposed to therapy dogs during the course versus stress management coursework alone. Jalongo and McDevitt (2015) found that staff were viewed as more approachable while therapy dogs were present, suggesting that students may feel more connected to and comfortable with their professor in the classroom, which may make them more inclined to participate during lectures with the presence of a therapy dog. The potential impact of a canine’s presence on students’ distractibility is an area of concern that therapy dogs pose. Pendry et al. found only 2.9% of students reported dogs to be distracting to materials presented in the stress management course. The current research available on therapy dogs on college campuses primarily focuses on single event exposures and their effects on anxiety and stress with little research exploring the additional effects of an animal on distractibility and participation. Because of the limitations presented in previous research, this study explored the recurring effects of CAE in a college classroom setting on student anxiety and stress, distractibility, and participation over the course of 5 weeks. The results of this study will inform AAI research on effectiveness of a recurring CAE and inform higher education personnel of a low-cost intervention having potential to positively impact in-class learning for college students.
