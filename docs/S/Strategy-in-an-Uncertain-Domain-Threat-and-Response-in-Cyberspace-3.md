## Cyber Operations and Russian National Strategy 
Russian state efforts over the last decade to re-assert influence and relevance in global affairs have been described as a case of "asymmetric balancing." <sup>21</sup> The strategy aims to counterbalance adversaries through a range of actions to achieve effects without reaching the threshold of armed conflict with a major adversary. Notable cyber operations in this period that appear to be consistent with such a strategy are those against Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine in 2014, and 2016. The three cases are different, but indicate an evolving method of integrating cyber and conventional capabilities in combined operations.

Between April and May 2007, Estonia was the target of a series of cyberattacks against its government websites, banking system, internet service providers, telecommunications, and news agencies. There were three waves of attacks in total, ranging from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) to digital vandalism. The attacks had a significant effect on Estonia, a country that was already highly interconnected, with considerable digital access to public services. Estonia's digital exposure led its Foreign Minister to claim that the attacks were real, virtual and psychological. <sup>22</sup> The cyber operations against Estonia occurred in the context of growing tensions between Russia and Estonia over the relocation of a statue honoring Soviet soldiers. <sup>23</sup> Tensions escalated into public protests in Tallinn, amplified by Russia’s sharp public criticism of the statue’s relocation. <sup>24</sup> It was in this suggestive context of sharply deteriorating bilateral relations that the wave of cyber operations was conducted against Estonia.

The cyber operations also occurred in the context of a broader set of coercive or retaliatory actions: An unofficial blockade disrupting crossborder trade with Estonia; domestic political calls for diplomatic and economic sanctions; and attacks against the Estonian embassy in Moscow reportedly by national youth groups, unhindered by local law enforcement. The digital disruptions were conducted against strategic targets, such as financial services, communications hubs, and government websites. The then Estonian defence minister described the totality of the measures as a form of psychological terror. <sup>25</sup>

Attempts to trace the attack suggested that they originated in multiple countries, including Egypt, Peru, and Vietnam. <sup>26</sup> Furthermore, instructions on how to carry out the attacks had been published on the internet, multiplying the hypothetical points of origin of the attacks. Despite these elements of uncertainty, the political context and the operation’s scale and level of coordination was suggestive of some degree of Russian state involvement or toleration. <sup>27</sup> Needless to say, Russia has repeatedly rejected this allegation. The re-location of a monument in Tallinn did not pose a significant national security threat to Russia, representing perhaps more of a snub to national pride, particularly when carried out by a smaller neighbor. This suggests cyber operations could have been chosen as a low-cost response, perceived as entailing low risk.<sup>28</sup> The implausible deniability implicit in the cyber operations against Estonia highlighted the potential for states to conduct—or contract proxies to perpetrate—disruptive or destructive operations against adversaries in cyberspace whilst retaining both a consequential degree of uncertainty and a sense of restraint, for example, calibrating offensive operations to test, but not to flagrantly violate, the threshold for triggering the collective defence provision (Article 5) of the North Atlantic Treaty. This ensured that Russia was not subject to significant retaliatory measures following this episode.

The Estonia case should have served as a clear warning to states that improvements were necessary in cyber security practices in the public and private sectors to reduce the risk of being subject to damaging digital disruptions. <sup>29</sup> Unsurprisingly, Estonia acted on this warning. It introduced a range of measures improving national cyber defence and resilience. Estonia created a Cyber Defence League, a defence agency within the military hierarchy, comprising expert volunteers defending Estonia's digital infrastructure. Diplomatically, the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO) Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence—in preparation prior to the 2007 attacks—was created in 2008 and located in Tallinn. The Center represents a cyber knowledge-generation and -exchange initiative, improving NATO member states’ cyber defence capabilities.

Estonia was not the only state in this period to be subjected to digital disruptions during diplomatic contestation with Russia. In 2008, as the result of tensions arising from the separatist movement in South Ossetia and the country's growing proximity to NATO, the situation in Georgia deteriorated, culminating in a short period of armed conflict with Russia. Russian military operations were accompanied by cyber operations. <sup>30</sup> This represented a relatively new situation, regarded by one scholar as “the first case in history of a coordinated cyberspace domain attack synchronized with major combat actions in other warfighting domains.”<sup>31</sup>

As with Estonia, cyber operations against Georgia included DDoS attacks and digital vandalism against government websites, communication agencies, internet providers and the Georgian media. Georgia’s financial and transport infrastructure were targeted. Instructions for conducting DDoS attacks against Georgian servers had also been disseminated publicly, again illustrating an effort to empower proxies and/or shift blame. Georgia’s case differs from Estonia, however, due to the increased sophistication and coordination of the operations. One of the first sites to be taken down was a forum of Georgian hackers, to prevent attempts to reestablish interrupted services or to retaliate in cyberspace. <sup>32</sup> Following the disruption of Georgia’s communications infrastructure, Russian invaded with conventional armed forces. Analysis of the Georgia case has led some to argue that the extent of operational coordination implies the systematic integration of cyber domain operations with those of traditional forces at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. <sup>33</sup> Whatever the efforts to obscure ultimate responsibility for the cyber operations, the director of Georgia’s National Security Council argued that, in the context of armed conflict, Russian denials of responsibility were implausible. <sup>34</sup>

The Georgia case highlights the combination of implausibly denied cyber operations with avowed conventional military operations. On the ladder of uncertainty, the next logical step would be to align implausibly deniable cyber operations with implausibly deniable military operations, for example by creating uncertainty about command and control over units fighting in an adversary’s territory. Just six years later, this would become a salient feature of Russian operations against Ukraine from 2014 to present.

Prior to the 2014 invasion of Ukraine by Russia, bilateral diplomatic tensions had intensified in 2013 over Ukraine’s negotiations with the European Union and Russian fears that Ukraine was moving outside of its sphere of influence. <sup>35</sup> This prompted the operation to annex Crimea, with a hastily convened referendum to declare that a majority of the population voted to be incorporated into the Russian Federation. <sup>36</sup> Annexation of Crimea and continued destabilization of eastern Ukraine prompted a diplomatic response from the European Union and United States, in the form of coercive economic measures, without altering de facto Russian control of Crimea or on-going instability in eastern Ukraine. <sup>37</sup>

The cyber dimension of the attack on Ukraine involved efforts to destabilize the Ukraine government and create a climate of confusion and uncertainty between government and society, using digital disinformation operations including the production and dissemination of "fake news”. <sup>38</sup> In addition, the persistence of cyber operations undermined the effectiveness of communication between Ukraine’s government and armed forces. <sup>39</sup> The range of operations spanned information operations, with DDoS attacks against strategic websites; leaking government and private data; and messages sent to Ukraine military personnel to encourage desertion. Cyber operations were also conducted against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, resulting in a power blackout in Kiev.<sup>40</sup> Several Western states subsequently publicly attributed the blackout to Russian action. <sup>41</sup> Even so, global perceptions of Russia's culpability for cyber operations against Ukraine since 2014 have arguably come more from the political context than from widespread knowledge, understanding or acceptance of dispositive evidence of attribution. <sup>42</sup>

The Ukraine case introduces a significant element of the strategic debate about offensive cyber operations: The targeting of civilian infrastructure. As states develop offensive cyber capabilities, they are faced with consequential ethical and strategic decisions about how and when these capabilities should be used.<sup>43</sup> Offensive cyber operations can be used tactically or operationally, integrated in multi-domain operations, but the strategic targeting of critical infrastructure increases the risk that cyber operations lead to escalation out of the grey zone and into armed conflict. This is a particular risk given the confusion in public debate between incidents of cyber espionage and offensive cyber operations—both being labelled as cyber attacks requiring cost-imposition—that was discernible in the wake of the SolarWinds breach.<sup>44</sup> In the current environment, in which nation states possess a monopoly on the most sophisticated offensive cyber operational capabilities, the greater the degree of sophistication and alignment with operations in other domains that a given cyber operation required, the stronger will be the implicit assumption that such operations involved some form of state activity or direction, even if dispositive evidence of ultimate responsibility is unavailable. <sup>45</sup>

It is clear from these brief case studies that states are increasingly at risk from sophisticated cyber operations whether conducted in isolation or as part of a coordinated, multi-domain military operation. Both the range of techniques and the degree of integration with other domains appears to have improved during the 2000s. Recent tensions between Iran and the United States, and between Iran and Israel, have seen the reported use of cyber operations as part of carefully calibrated responses designed to control the potential for escalating conflict. <sup>46</sup>

As this section has aimed to demonstrate, a global and public debate is necessary to consider the strategic, institutional, and operational lessons that states should learn from contemporary developments in cyber operations and their role in international relations. Such a debate has developed over the last decade, but is uneven and largely dominated by U.S. voices and issues. This is unsurprising, given the weight of U.S. cyber power, but it risks the distortive impact of assuming that the threats and opportunities of offensive cyber operations affect all states equally. There is a need for a wider global conversation, one that is sensitive to the contingencies and modalities of cyber security in different national and regional contexts.<sup>47</sup>
