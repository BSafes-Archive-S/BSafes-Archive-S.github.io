## Demographics of Schizophrenic inmates in the prison system
Over half of all individuals incarcerated in jails and prisons have a mental health problem (Ramsey, et. al, 2011). In regards to Schizophrenia, little to no attention is given to incarcerated people experiencing psychotic symptoms or a psychotic episode for the first time. Criticism of the results of early research of individuals with schizophrenia focuses on considerable bias involving the over-inclusion of chronically ill patients, and the fact that a majority of the psychosocial conditions that correspond with schizophrenia amass before receiving treatment (Ramsey et. al, 2011).

Ramsey, along with several other authors conducted a study of first time psychosis arrestees, although their population selection was a limited sample. Despite extremely high incarceration rates in the first-episode samples that authors Ramsey, et. al have gathered , it should be taken into consideration that that sample consisted largely of young, African American males, most of whom did complete high school, and their lack of education also placed them at high risk for incarceration (Ramsey, et. al, 2011). Socioeconomic status and factors are what made the authors population sample possible, although it is still limiting in terms of gender, age and race, as the study did not include women, adults, and individuals of varying other races.
