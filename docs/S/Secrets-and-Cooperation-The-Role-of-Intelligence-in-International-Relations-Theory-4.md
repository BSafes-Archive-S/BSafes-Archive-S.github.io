## Classic Liberalism
Classic Liberalism is among the most widely studied theories in international relations. This is because many Western democracies that exist today, the United States included, exist as a result from Liberal thinkers like John Locke (1632-1704) or Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Their research and literature equipped and enabled thinkers to challenge the status quo of what it meant to be governed and to govern. Liberals advocate for free and fair elections, human and civil rights, and the rule of law. Where, then, does intelligence play a role? Dunne et al. (2016) wrote that the Classic Liberal thinker holds the position that “war and conflict can be overcome or mitigated through concerted changes in both the domestic and international structures of governance” (p. 69). In twenty-first century America, this governance is far beyond what Locke and Kant advocated for. Today, the federal government is much bigger than what they envisioned, and it certainly has more control and influence on global affairs. Nevertheless, Classic Liberalism still advocates for cooperation to achieve good and effective governance.

Intelligence, thus, is central to governance in the modern world. It drives IR policies and national defense strategies. Pinkus (2014), however, has a stern warning. Intelligence can be politicized, and when it is, its value is undermined, and achieving national policy objectives becomes more difficult. One such example is when political leaders interpret the intelligence assessments they receive into their own personal narratives, often with political spin. Pinkus (2014) wrote that “the main risk of using intelligence for public diplomacy is that even when intelligence does not directly contradict what policymakers want it to reveal, it will likely introduce nuances that create political difficulties. These nuances can tempt policymakers to distort information when they present it to the public” (p. 35). Is this, however, a weakness to the Liberal IR theory? It can be. Consider the amount of power, influence, and trust liberal democracies enjoy in their elected representatives. Few Americans pay attention to the “nuances” of the intelligence community and its work, and thus, they easily choose to believe whatever someone in a position of influence tells them or what they may hear in the news or social media.

Intelligence and diplomacy are not only politicized in liberal democracies, but also in states that are run by brutal dictators. The fundamental concepts of Classic Liberalism—freedom, free speech, and so many others—are very much present in recent history, and of course, politics and governance play an important calculation. Look no further than the Arab Spring, which began in Egypt in 2011 and was felt in neighboring Libya, Tunisia, and portions of the Middle East such as Syria. The citizens of these dictator-run countries protested their oppressive government out of a sense of nationalism, desire for freedom, and a demand for basic human rights. The United States was seen as a nation that would undoubtedly support the people of North Africa and the Middle East. 

Burns (2020) wrote that, at the time, President Barack Obama did not wish to make the plight for freedom a political football. Responding with military force would not be the preferred course of action, but rather diplomacy. This proved difficult, especially during the Syrian Civil War. When Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his own people, President Obama was placed in a difficult position, revealing another potential weakness to the Classic Liberalism IR theory. The Administration received credible intelligence that sarin gas was used by the Assad regime to kill thousands of civilians. “Assad has not only crossed our red line but had violated a crucial international norm” (p. 329). Burns argued that if military retaliatory action is used based on “incontestable” intelligence, such a response should not be viewed as “regime change” or “direct intervention in the civil war” (p. 330).

The role of intelligence in Classic Liberalism can thus be defined as a means of gathering reports and observations of acts being performed by dictators and nation states in direct competition with the United States. The Arab Spring and the Syrian Civil War revealed that intelligence helps paint a picture of the social and political unrest that often unfolds in these non-democratic states.
