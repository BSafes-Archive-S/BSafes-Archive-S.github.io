## 1. Introduction
With the emerging field in internet and communication technologies, we can take the human life virtual world step by step. As human live in a physical world, it is not at all possible for them to work, chat, keep pets and plants in the virtual world cannot be implemented fully in human activities. Hence, it is quite difficult to enhance the service excellence with the development of internet virtual world. The technology which combines both virtual world and real world is termed as Internet of Things (IoT). It will change the human life style by fulfilling the new demands of human being with future society as well as the business model by using a low cost sensor network and wireless communication technology [1] [2]. In IoT, many physical devices are connected to communicate and exchange vital information related to healthcare, office, house hold objects like kitchen appliances, humidity and temperature control etc.

This technology ensures to empower the commodity and successfully proven to handle any hazardous and repeated task. It also helps in replacing physical labor through technology, thus satisfying individual needs. Up-gradation of various technologies in IoT using computers and mobile devices emerge the remote access of smart homes, healthcare, smart energy, Military and industry automation systems, which are the real life applications of IoT. We will discuss briefly about the various application areas and role of IoT in COVID19 of the current pandemic in health care systems. However, in coming future the huge implementation of IoT in different areas also need to face many security and privacy issues for smart, connected and mobile IoT devices and challenges of IoT.

In particular, the cryptographic properties such as data confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and authorization must be provided by IoT for the security solution of IoT nodes (i.e. things, users. servers, objects). In addition, the privacy protection must be considered [1].

### 1.1 Contributions
The Internet of Things connects a massive number of devices, users, and their related services and apps, allowing them to interact with one another. While this improves the user experience, it also raises a number of security concerns. Numerous proposals have been proposed to handle IoT security challenges, including access control, privacy, trust, identity, and so forth. The majority of these are concerned with finding answers to specific problems. To the best of our knowledge, there is no complete set of standards for an IoT security architecture that satisfies all of the needs of an IoT system as of now. This complicates the safe, resilient, and scalable deployment of IoT applications and services. We emphasize that current security architectures do not adequately recognize and incorporate an IoT system's characteristics and security-specific requirements. The larger scale of IoT systems and the wide range of applications will necessitate the development of a security architecture that takes into account the many characteristics of such systems. In this study, we attempt to bridge the gap by synthesizing existing recommendations for state-of-the-art IoT security criteria into a single publication. We intend to address the following key research topic in particular: what are the needs for the design and provision of security for the IoT? The majority of the preceding proposals make no distinction between various security concerns and IoT security requirements. In other words, they do not cover the technical issues and characteristics required to generate a list of IoT security criteria. While some of them address the needs on an individual basis, they do not provide a thorough survey.

Rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 gives overviews and background along with an analysis on architecture of IoT and real life application of IoT and section3 will provide a brief discussion on security and privacy of IoT, section 4 draws the conclusion of the review with references at the end.
