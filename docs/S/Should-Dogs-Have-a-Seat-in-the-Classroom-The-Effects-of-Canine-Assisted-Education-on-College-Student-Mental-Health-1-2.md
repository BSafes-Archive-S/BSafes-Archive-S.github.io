## Person-Environment-Occupation Model and AAI
Theory can be used to describe, explain, and predict behavior and relationships between people, objects, and the environment. The person-environment-occupation (PEO) model is a theoretical framework that supports the exploration of the effect of AAI on the college student population. This model provides the framework to allow researchers to investigate the fit between personal and environmental factors and their influence on individuals’ occupational performance in their role as students. Contextually, the person is described as college students who are typically the developmental age of 18 to 22 years. These individuals experience a transitionary period where they may be leaving stable physical and social environments for the first time. This transition includes moving into a dormitory or apartment surrounded by unfamiliar, same aged peers, in addition to leaving established social relationships, including pets. Often, students are met with new demands and may experience additional stressors, such as work-life balance between employment and academic duties, juggling new social relationships with the addition of navigating unfamiliar social pressures and schemes, and participating in roles and activities outside of their collegiate identities. The primary role of a college-aged individual is student, in which academic performance and maintaining their academic studies is their main occupation. The student role involves expected academic demands, including participation in classroom activities and maintaining attention throughout class (i.e., decreased distractibility). In addition, the struggle of maintaining demands from academic and non-academic roles frequently leads to perceived anxiety and stress as students attempt to juggle occupational performance, which is the transaction between themselves as the individual, their new physical and social environment in a college or university setting, and their occupations surrounding academics and roles in leisure (Law et al., 1996).

The significant environmental and occupational shifts experienced by college students often lead to incongruence of the person, environment, and occupation domains of a student resulting in occupational performance declines. These occupational performance declines may include decreased well-being resulting from high anxiety and stress, low levels of fulfillment in the individual’s role as a college student, or poor grades. This study investigates the potential to decrease negative personal factors such as anxiety, stress, and distraction to maximize positive personal factors, such as participation through the introduction of a therapy dog into the college students’ (person) natural environment (classroom; see Figure 1). This study also considers whether modifications to a college classroom environment, such as the introduction of a therapy dog, demonstrate the potential to impact a student’s overall occupational performance and reduce the negative impacts students often experience through transitions into unfamiliar environments and occupations (see Figure 1). AAIs have an emerging role in assisting students in meeting academic demands and decreasing perceived anxiety and stress as they attempt to maintain each aspect of the PEO performance as a college student.

The expansion of disciplines using animals in practice in therapeutic and recreational settings resulted in the need to define and categorize types of animal interventions into more specific categories (Binfet & Hartwig, 2020). AAI is an umbrella term that includes several categories of animal interventions with the requirement of being goal-oriented, structured, and leading to individuals demonstrating therapeutic gains (International Association for Human-Animal Interaction Organizations, 2018). AAIs include animal assisted activities, animal assisted education, and animal assisted therapy. Binfet and Hartwig (2020) acknowledge the variability in animal assisted terminology and stress the importance of streamlining language in order to advance understanding and work in the field. Identifying the species used in animal intervention studies is an important factor in reducing terminology variability in the field. The researchers in this study chose an animal intervention that is categorized as animal assisted education and can be further defined as canine assisted education (CAE). CAE occurs in a school or classroom setting and is carried out by teachers or professors with the goal of incorporating canines with students to reach academic goals (Binfet & Hartwig, 2020). Investigators aimed to explore how student factors related to in-class learning (anxiety, stress, distractibility, and participation) were impacted by the presence of a therapy dog, thus they chose to implement CAE for this study.
