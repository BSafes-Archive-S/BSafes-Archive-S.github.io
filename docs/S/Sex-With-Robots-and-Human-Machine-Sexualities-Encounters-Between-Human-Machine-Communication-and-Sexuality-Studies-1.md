## HMC and the Machine-Other
HMC constitutes a rapidly growing field within the broader realm of communication studies focused on the ways in which humans interact with machine-others. What sets HMC apart from related fields is the focus on the communication processes between humans and machines in which the machine is not rendered as a channel through which humans communicate, but as “a communicative subject” with whom humans interact (Guzman, 2018, p. 12; Fortunati & Edwards, 2020). I use “machine-others” (rather than “machine” itself) to highlight this communicative subjectivization of the machine in HMC encounters. Understood as “*the creation of meaning among humans and machines*” (Guzman, 2018, p. 1, emphasis in original), HMC addresses topics such as agency (Banks & de Graaf, 2020), ontological boundaries (Edwards, 2018; Guzman, 2020), and the role and applicability of human-to-human scripts to human-machine encounters (Dehnert & Leach, 2021; Westerman et al., 2020).

In the context of HMC, the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm—and, more recently, the Media Are Social Actors (MASA) paradigm (Lombard & Xu, 2021)—and constructivist approaches have been utilized to describe the ways in which humans relate to and interact with machines (e.g., Gambino et al., 2020; Nass & Moon, 2000; Westerman et al., 2020). Roughly (for reviews see Fortunati & Edwards, 2021; Westerman et al., 2020), CASA/MASA and constructivist approaches explain the ways in which humans apply previously learned communication scripts to their encounters with machines. Conceiving of human-machine encounters through a Buberian I-Thou framework allows for the application of human-human communication theories to HMC contexts (Westerman et al., 2020). Recently, however, scholars have called for mobilizing a critical communication perspective in HMC to reconsider the ways in which the machine-other is otherized in human-machine encounters, asking questions related to ableism, gendered and sexed dynamics, as well as processes of racialization (Fortunati & Edwards, 2021; e.g., Davis & Stanovsek, 2021; Dehnert & Leach, 2021; Liu, 2021; Moran, 2020).

The context of sex robots offers unique vantage points for furthering critical perspectives in HMC. On the one hand, this context allows for drawing on the rich literature in SeS—where sexuality emerges as a sociohistorical formation, “a vital means of pleasure, interpersonal connection, personal efficacy, and acceptance of one’s body and of self more generally” (Wilkerson, 2011, p. 194). Thus, in addition to previous critical work in HMC, the context of sex robots invites other intersectional markers of difference theorized in SeS, queer and trans (of color) criticism, and feminist and crip theories: In addition to dis/ability, this involves sex, sexuality, gender, race, class, and age, among others.

On the other hand, sex robots allow for exploring the complex implications of communicative sexual machine-others on intimate relations, including major social, legal, political, and ethical implications regarding the role of sex/uality for humans. After all, as Flore (2014) insists, “The birth of the sexual sciences, and the development of sexology and psychiatry, were and remain an attempt to define and delimit the meaning of being human itself ” (p. 18, emphasis in original; see also Foucault, 1978). Similarly, HMC engages ontological questions regarding the divides between humans, machines, and animals (Edwards, 2018; Guzman, 2020). For instance, although CASA states that humans treat machines as if they were people, “we may not always respond to people in a very interpersonal way,” meaning that human-human interaction is oftentimes heavily scripted (Westerman et al., 2020, p. 403). This opens profound questions about what exactly characterizes human-human relationality and how it differs from human-machine relationality (Dehnert, 2021; Westerman et al., 2020).

In the context of asexuality studies, Flore (2014) argued that “to be human is to be sexual” and outlined the ways in which sexuality is compulsory in the context of the human (p. 19). In the following section, I take up Flore’s and other SeS scholars’ insights regarding the ways in which sexual science and sexology pathologize, otherize, and violently exclude deviance in sexual behavior, orientation, and identity to add to the ongoing conversations on sex robots and their implications. I review existing research on sex robots from an interdisciplinary perspective to highlight the ripe potential of conjoining this body of literature with HMC, specifically punctuating and extending Flore and Pienaar’s (2020) notion of sexuotechnical-assemblage.
