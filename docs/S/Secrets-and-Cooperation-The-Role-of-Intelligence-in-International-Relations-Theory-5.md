## Neoliberalism
This theory in IR embraces alliances and partnerships. It argues that the world today is an institutional in nature and as such, global powers, economies, and societies operate in such a way that they cannot be successful without relying on each other to a certain degree. The international system requires cooperation. Much of this is accomplished not through individual nation states, as Realism would approach it, but through organizations made up of international participants. Neoliberalism emerged after World War II and at first was focused on economic cooperation, but the theory quickly applied to security cooperation as well during the Cold War, a time when tensions remained high between the United States, the Soviet Union, and other nations that still felt the vulnerabilities of World War II. Scholars of Neoliberalism, therefore, teach that common threats lead to common ground. When nation states face a like adversary or a like threat, their instinct is to protect themselves and each other. The establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is a fitting example of an organization that emerged from a great, global conflict with the aim of promoting regional security, cooperation among states, and diplomatic partnerships.

Intelligence comes plays a role in Neoliberalism by being a method by which nation states, through international organizations, can share with each other their concerns about regional and global challenges. Such intel often comes in many forms. Whether it is open-source intelligence on the open internet or classified, clandestine reporting through diplomatic channels, allies can not only build on the trust they already have with each other, but potentially foster new ways to approach and study regional and global threats. However, credibility in intelligence is important and establishing it must be the first step. Tuzuner (2010) explained that “the best way to change mindsets about intelligence cooperation on an international level is to start from home. We must first make the different domestic level intelligence agencies cooperate and share information with each other” (p. 7). In the intelligence community, there are seventeen federal agencies, whose work is unique from their counterparts. The intelligence arms of the uniformed service branches, for example, collect and analyze intelligence that is specific to their fighting domains or areas of responsibility. The Air Force will collect intelligence on Russia or China’s airpower and capabilities, while the Navy may approach their naval assets in a similar fashion.

The best example of cooperation at home is the relationship that the intelligence community has with the Department of State. The central themes of Neoliberalism are seen through the inter-connected work of these two organizations. Although the State Department has its own intel arm, known as the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, it still relies on intelligence assessments from the greater IC. It is common for Ambassadors, Foreign Service Officers, and military attachés to gather reports and other products to develop security cooperation initiatives, diplomatic strategies, and other forms of assessments vital to the U.S. diplomatic mission within a country. James R. Clapper, former Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) director in the Clinton Administration and Director of National Intelligence in the Obama Administration, assesses that if cooperation cannot exist among U.S. agencies, it certainly cannot exist between the United States and another nation. “When agencies cooperate, one defines the problem and seeks help with it. When they act jointly, the problem and options for actions are defined differently from the start” (Clapper, 2019, p. 102).

Although Neoliberalism promotes cooperation among states through institutions such as NATO, there are other forms of cooperation, specific to intelligence, that are equally effective. One such example is the Five Eyes (FVEY) alliance. It was established in May 1943 by President Franklin Roosevelt and was at first a bilateral partnership with the United Kingdom in a joint effort to share intelligence and eliminate the threat to Europe by the Axis powers. Three years later, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand joined the agreement. The DIA, the United States’ lead military intelligence agency, values the FVEY alliance, saying “Today, the FVEY partnership is the longest recorded formal intelligence relationship in history. For more than 70 years, through numerous conflicts and over the course of dozens of administrations, the FVEY relationship has proven to be an invaluable tool in safeguarding the security interests for each country” (Defense Intelligence Agency Public Affairs, 2019). This is the type of partnership for which Neoliberalism advocates. Despite being strong advocates for alliances and cooperation through institutional organizations, Neoliberals, like Realists, are cautious in their approach to cooperation. “Because states fear that their cooperative partners may fail to live up to mutual agreements, states may be discouraged from engaging in cooperative projects in the first place” (Dunne et al., 2016, p. 96). This is a legitimate concern, especially in today’s very dynamic and rapidly changing world.

Among Realism, Classic Liberalism, and Neoliberalism, Neoliberalism appears to be the most effect IR theory that achieves diplomatic cooperation while leveraging the critical role of the intelligence community. This IR theory is effective in the twenty-first century because great powers such as Russia and China are only becoming more assertive in their quest for global hegemony. They seek to undermine democratic values, weaken military and economic alliances they view as threatening, and expand their sphere of influence through forceful and at times illegal means. To this end, intelligence sharing and collaboration among the United States and its allies will allow for better situational awareness on adversarial motives, plans, and intentions. Additionally, it will allow for strong bonds to become even stronger and more enduring. This is exactly what Pashakhanlou (2017) wrote about in his study. He observed that “intelligence is used in this context to avoid strategic surprise. Specifically, it helps determine whether other states’ military capabilities are merely intended for defensive purposes or if they might be employed offensively” (p. 522). Intelligence cooperation is a form of diplomacy, and thus, can lead to military cooperation and great security measures being taken to deter adversaries. Neoliberalism, therefore, advocates for enhanced cooperation through intelligence because it leads to other forms of cooperation and more enduring partner relations.

Tuzuner (2010) was very blunt in his call for cooperation among nation states to achieve a more secure global environment and the role of intelligence in achieving these ends. Because security challenges are becoming more nuanced and global competition is increasing on all fronts, “countries should be more eager than ever to cooperate. The threats should be taken care of and controlled by mutual collaboration, cooperation, and coordination among internal and external intelligence institutions within and among countries” (p. 46). Allies cannot provide effective security or intelligence support to each other without on-going dialogue where various opinions and ideas are exchanged.
