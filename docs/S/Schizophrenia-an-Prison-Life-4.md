## Inaccuracies of in media on Schizophrenia and the reality of the disorder
Violence is sometimes directed at family, and friends, and mostly in private. Drug and alcohol abuse may lead to violence in schizophrenic individuals. It should be noted that violence is not a symptom of Schizophrenia, and many individuals with schizophrenia are far more likely to cause harm to themselves rather than another individual a majority of the time (Schizophrenia and Poverty, Crime and Violence, 2010).

The type of crimes that those with schizophrenia would be incarcerated for is not usually violence or homicide, but rather for causing misdemeanors instead. A great majority of individuals who have been incarcerated and are diagnosed with schizophrenia in jail have been charged with misdemeanors such as trespassing (Schizophrenia and Poverty, Crime and Violence, 2010). Those who discontinue their medication, or have paranoid or psychotic symptoms may have a higher rate of violent behavior. The news and entertainment, specifically television shows that depict a fictionalized portrayal of the disorder, and other forms of media tend to exaggerate. The reality is that this disorder is more often than not far from the fictional portrayal often witnessed in the media.
