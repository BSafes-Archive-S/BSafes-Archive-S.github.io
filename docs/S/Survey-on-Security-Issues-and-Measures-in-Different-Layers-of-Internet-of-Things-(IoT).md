**Abstract**: In general perspective, Internet of things is defined as a network of physical objects by connecting” things to things” through the sensors, actuators and processors, to communicate and exchange data and information among each other along with other related devices and systems spread over different locations, without human-to-human or human-to-computer interactions. This survey summarizes all the security threats along with privacy issues that may be confronted by the end users in Internet of Things (IoT). The majority of survey is to gather information about the current security requirements for IoT, the further scope and the challenges in IoT and the measures to prevent attacks upon the IoT systems.

**Keywords**: Threats, Internet of Things (IoT), Security, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Privacy
