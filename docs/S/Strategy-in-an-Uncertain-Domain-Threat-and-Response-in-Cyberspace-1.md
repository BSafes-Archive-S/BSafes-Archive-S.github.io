## Introduction
Edward Snowden’s 2013 revelations about the practices of the U.S. National Security Agency and its allies in the 5 Eyes partnership highlighted the prevalence of digital espionage and the challenges faced by states in improving communications security and protecting digital data. <sup>1</sup> The contemporaneous rise in offensive cyber operations as a tool of state and non-state actors has required greater priority to cyber defence and offense in national strategies. Cyber operations against adversary infrastructure are now an increasingly common part of a state’s toolkit, whether the reportedly US-Israeli *Stuxnet* operation against Iranian nuclear infrastructure, or the reportedly Russian cyber operations against targets in Estonia, Georgia, and Ukraine. <sup>2</sup>

A state’s cyber power is therefore an increasingly important component of wider national power. <sup>3</sup> It is a relevant dimension in national efforts to enhance socio-economic development and prosperity, information security, national resilience, domestic security and national defence. It is, therefore, a cross-cutting priority in national security strategy.

This article focuses on one aspect of the strategic impact of cyber operations, namely the problem of uncertainty and the challenge of establishing widespread acceptance of attribution. The problem of cyber uncertainty is manifested in a congested grey zone of competition and conflict between state and non-state actors. With asymmetries of knowledge and understanding between state actors and within the global public sphere, uncertainty is a pervasive feature of the cyber domain. The article draws on case study analysis to highlight the challenges that states must address in cyberspace. The article concludes with an assessment of contemporary cyber power and a tentative forecast of future directions for national strategy.
