## Discussion
The objective of this research project was to explore the impact of the presence of a therapy dog (CAE) on college students in their natural environment, a college classroom. The research design specifically analyzed dependent variables, including anxiety and stress, distractibility, and participation levels of entry-level college students. The significant differences noted between the pre-test and post-test scores suggested a therapy dog in the classroom positively impacted student participation and anxiety and stress while not having an effect on students’ level of distraction, which presents a positive outlook on the potential of including therapy dog programming at colleges and universities to increase students’ mental health and overall learning experience.

### Anxiety and Stress
The study reveals a significant relationship between the presence of a therapy dog in the classroom and college student anxiety and stress. The findings in this study were similar to those in the literature in demonstrating a reduction in anxiety and stress. The majority of researchers who have measured anxiety and stress in the college setting have done so at one-time events through counseling centers and outreach events before or after final exams (Barker et al., 2016; Binfet, 2017; Blender & Ryan, 2009; Jalongo & McDevitt, 2015; Jarolmen & Patel, 2018; Pendry & Vandagriff, 2019). The results of this study indicate the benefit recurring therapy dog interventions through CAE may have on college students’ stress and anxiety.

The far reaching, positive effects on anxiety and stress across the majority of the classroom indicate a means to support the overwhelmed college counseling centers. Positive impacts, starting in the classroom, have the potential to decrease student need for 1:1 counseling. This in turn can decrease the extended wait times (Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors, 2018) for services and provide increased opportunities for services for those who need it most in the counseling centers. In addition, with 69% (18 of 26) of the students reporting the presence of the therapy dog to decrease their perceived anxiety and stress, CAE demonstrates the ability to assist meeting the socialemotional and scheduling needs of the high number of students who feel they do not have time to seek out counseling opportunities (Ebert et al., 2019, p. 5; Yorgason et al., 2008) or even attend therapy dog events outside of their scheduled class times. These results support access to mental health benefits for students who are embarrassed or resistant to initiate counseling services themselves by bringing possible relief to the comfort of their classroom (Yorgason et al., 2008). Lastly, this also provides a financially conscious option for colleges and students’ alike who are concerned with the cost of direct mental health services (Ebert et al., 2019, p. 5; Yorgason et al., 2008).

### Distraction
This study is among the first to analyze the potential impact of distractibility from a therapy dog in a learning environment. Although results did not show statistically significant changes in the area of distractibility, this may suggest the limited impact of the dog’s presence, positive or negative, on student engagement and focus on presented class materials. However, this finding may be viewed as beneficial, as results did indicate a decrease in distraction levels, although not at a statistically significant level. The lack of significance with distractibility may also indicate that the therapy dog’s inclusion promoted decreased anxiety and stress and increased participation without taking away from the coursework and learning opportunities in the class. These results mirror those by Pendry et al. (2019). In addition, as students become more familiar with one another throughout the 5-week period, it would be expected that distractibility would increase. Therefore, despite possible increased comfort with classmates, the professor, and the therapy dog over the 5-week period, there were not significant changes to distractibility.

### Participation
Although most researchers measured the effect of therapy dogs on students through counseling centers and outreach events (Barker et al., 2016; Binfet, 2017; Grajfoner et al., 2017), Pendry et al. (2019) also studied therapy dogs in a classroom environment with a focus on understanding the effects on students’ academic outcomes, which is a gap in the literature. Results from Pendry et al.’s study revealed that students who engaged with therapy dogs alone or in educational content with the presence of a therapy dog, had significantly higher scores and perceived usefulness compared to students that engaged with educational content alone. These results align with the results of the current study with students reporting significantly increased participation levels in class activities during CAE. Therefore, the outcomes of this research indicate the presence of a dog in the classroom may benefit the college student population by decreasing anxiety and stress and increasing student participation in the classroom while not increasing distractibility. These effects are likely to result in improved overall academic outcomes and achievement.

### Theoretical Implications
The findings of this study are supported by the PEO model by demonstrating the positive implications of the presence of a therapy dog in the college classroom and the potential benefits to the PEO role of a college student. College students function in a multitude of roles, environments, and occupations, which are influenced heavily by fluctuations in external and internal factors. This study indicates that the inclusion of a therapy dog in a college classroom has the potential to provide positive benefits to the internal factors of a student, including their response to stress, anxiety, and distractibility. The influence of internal factors may bring change to a student’s external factors, such as their participation in the classroom, which may further impact their perception of their sense of self and performance as a student. The positive adjustments the inclusion of a therapy dog in the classroom was found to have on the students’ personal factors, then has the potential to carry over to students’ additional roles, environments, and/or occupations. For example, decreased anxiety and stress that may have resulted from the dog’s presence may also improve the congruence of the three domains and ultimately the occupational performance in the student’s job outside of the classroom. The more harmonious the balance between the PEO of an individual, the greater the potential to reduce negative impacts on a student’s mental health on a college campus. When analyzing mental health on college campuses through the lens of the PEO model, this study demonstrates a significant yet cost-effective means of potentially positively influencing a student’s response to stress and anxiety through the modification of the environment to include the presence of a therapy dog.

### Implications for OT
In the profession of OT, the findings from this study have the potential to impact the careers and performance of future occupational therapists through impacting OT students’ themselves first. Occupational therapists have a unique role in treating the whole person. Therefore, OT academic programs have a vital duty to apply the same framework to their education programs. In order to effectively treat the whole person, occupational therapists are highly trained in collaboration with the client’s multidisciplinary team. A scoping review has identified that most OT services provided in post-secondary education exist primarily in student populations who demonstrate mental health needs (Keptner & McCarthy, 2020). Important themes that emerged from the review include focusing on skills required for success, importance of using the campus environment, and campus collaboration (Keptner & McCarthy, 2020). Our current study aligns with themes from the scoping review as it discusses the impact of mental health and stress on educational performance and demonstrates the value of potential campus collaborations with counseling services with the introduction of therapy dogs in classrooms. The current study also demonstrates use of the campus environment by implementing CAE in the classroom.

The currentstudy provides a positive and proactive option for occupational therapists and/or higher education personnel to offer support not only to the students’ academic achievements, but also for their personal development and mental health as well. OT programs, as well as other specialized health profession programs, are intensive, often involving practical educational and clinical experiences both during the typical student semesters as well as during the summers (National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy [NBCOT], 2018). This indicates a significant time and financial commitment. In addition, with college students frequently indicating high stress and anxiety (ACHA, 2019), the high rigor of OT programs make OT students no exception. This current research study outlines an option to provide OT students an opportunity for mental health support without additional time or financial commitments. This model supports the requests by Keptner and McCarthy (2020) for increased attention to preventative mental health measures by occupational therapists. The improved well-being and mental health of students in the profession has the potential to positively impact their success in the programs, which as a result may promote a profound impact on students’ competence, confidence, and clinical skills as they enter the OT profession as clinicians. This idea may be expanded on in future research endeavors to show how these benefits may cross varying practice settings in which anxiety and stress are common symptoms experienced by clients and therapists alike. Finally, from the perspective of a professor, the inclusion of a therapy dog has the potential to lead to feeling more rewarded in their profession through increased student participation and engagement.

### Study Limitations and Implications for Future Research
The largest limitations to this study were a small sample size and the lack of a control group. Unfortunately, another section of the Introduction to Occupational Science course was not available to conduct the intervention. Future studies should consider using courses with multiple sections to allow for different conditions, including treatment and control, to take place. Inclusion of a control group would significantly reduce threats to internal validity. In addition, increasing sample size and population demographics would reduce threats to external validity. In future studies researchers should consider implementing a similar therapy dog intervention in courses with multiple sections and larger class sizes in order to increase the number of participants. Also, the inclusion of students in the entry-level OT program may have limited gender and demographics of study population. Similar to the current study’s findings, the 2017 NBCOT Practice Analysis found 80.1% of registered occupational therapists reported identifying as white and 91.8% reported identifying as female, indicating the OT field to have a narrow participant focus (NBCOT, 2018). Future research should explore classes of different majors to reach a broad range of student participants, particularly in specialized programs such as health professional programs. As class size used in this study was fairly small, the students may have had more interaction and impact from the therapy dog than a large class format. Thus, future research should study the optimal ratio of class size to therapy dog or ratio of number of participants to therapy dog.

The use of a self-created assessment was an additional limitation. Although there is a limited number of college-aged distraction and participation measures, more rigorous options should be explored. Similarly, both a physiological and self-rated measure for perceived anxiety and stress should be explored to differentiate both the body and mind’s response to therapy dog intervention. In addition, the time constraints of an academic semester was a limitation on the study as the PI needed to ensure it was possible to implement the study in one academic semester because of schedule changes and drop-out that could occur the following semester. Future studies should continue to investigate avenues for making therapy dog programming accessible to more students, including graduate and professional students of various majors.

When discussing future research, another avenue that could be explored is to compare therapy dog programming across majors and schools within the college campus to determine if the type of classroom setting has implications as well. Comparing student reactions to inclusion of therapy dogs in college classrooms may vary between analytical students and creative arts students. This study was limited to one major area of study in a college setting that houses 90 different majors for undergraduate students to pursue. Exploring the impact of therapy dogs in a college classroom with other majors may lead to further research involving the benefits of CAE.
