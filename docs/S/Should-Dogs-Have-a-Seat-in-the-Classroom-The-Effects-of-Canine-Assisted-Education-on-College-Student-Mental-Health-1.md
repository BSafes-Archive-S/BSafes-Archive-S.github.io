## Mental Health Effects on Occupational Performance of Students in Higher Education
The connection between mental health and academic performance in college-aged students has gained more attention in recent decades with university and college personnel seeking new ways to offer mental health services to students on campus. In an effort to provide a more effective intervention for student health needs, the ACHA created the NCHA to determine areas in which students’ well-being are impacted the most (ACHA, 2019). The ACHA defined barriers to academic performance as students receiving lower grades on exams or in courses, dropping a course, receiving an incomplete in a course, or experiencing a significant interference in thesis or dissertation work (ACHA, 2019). In 2019, students reporting to the NCHA cited that the factors impeding their academic performance the most included stress (36.5%), anxiety (29.5%), sleep difficulties (24.3%), and depression (21.6%), which have been increasing over the past few years and reached all-time highs in 2019. Stress, anxiety, sleep difficulties, and depression were selected from a list of over 30 factors, including work responsibilities, health problems, relationship difficulties, internet usage, injury, and drug and alcohol use. Despite the increasing number of students reporting concerns with mental health, the wait time for a first counseling appointment averaged 17.7 days in 2018, suggesting the inability of counseling centers to meet students’ needs (Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors, 2018). One study explored barriers to accessing mental health services, noting that only 24.6% of students reported they “would definitely” seek help if they experienced an emotional problem, with cost (24.1%) and time/scheduling (22.6%) being highlighted as specific factors decreasing students’ willingness to seek therapy (Ebert et al., 2019, p. 5). In a study by Yorgason, Lineville, and Zitzman (2008), 18% of students reported that cost was a limiting factor to their use of mental health services. This study also discovered that 30% of students were unaware of available mental health services on campus, with students citing “not enough time” and “lack of knowledge” as the top two limiting factors to access (p. 177). Attitudinal barriers, such as wanting to handle the problem independently, feelings of embarrassment, and lack of knowledge surrounding services, propound the need to use alternative therapy interventions. AAI has the potential to ameliorate the barriers through providing low-cost interventions and allowing greater ease of access to services while decreasing the need for student disclosure, thereby eliminating attitudinal barriers and increasing social participation.

Previous research studies have explored the use of cost-effective interventions to help combat pretest and posttest anxiety in college students. One such study examined anxiety levels in students who participated in a 20-min coloring activity and 20 min of peer engagement after an examination (Burton & Baxter, 2019). This study found that both groups dropped in anxiety levels, but the group participating in a coloring leisure activity demonstrated significantly greater reduction in anxiety over the peer group (Burton & Baxter, 2019). The majority of the studies reviewed demonstrated findings in sample events, often during a pretest or posttest period. There are few studies available that examine long-term stress and anxiety reducers through recurring sessions or that explore treatment interventions outside of coloring or mindfulness practices.

Traditional treatment services include individual 1:1 counseling as well as group interventions, but the costs associated with staffing mental health professionals and providing services are prohibitive for the needs of large college campuses. As numbers of students reporting mental health concerns multiply, college campuses should consider looking toward AAI as a low-cost intervention model. Adams et al. (2017) discussed the benefits of AAI for college counselors with limited budgets, stating the current attitude of “do more with less” is possible through AAI as it can provide significant benefits with minimal resource investment (p. 317). The costs for having a dog tested and registered as a therapy dog from a reputable organization ranges from $10 to $100 for the first year with renewal costs of approximately $30 to $70 for subsequent years (Therapy Dogs International, 2020). College campuses may find it more cost effective to establish volunteer therapy dog programs that create regular programming for students rather than to hire additional mental health professionals at a salary wage.
