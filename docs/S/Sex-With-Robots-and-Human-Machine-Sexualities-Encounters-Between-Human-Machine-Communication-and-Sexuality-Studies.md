## Abstract
Sex robots are a controversial topic. Understood as artificial-intelligence enhanced humanoid robots designed for use in partnered and solo sex, sex robots offer ample opportunities for theorizing from a Human-Machine Communication (HMC) perspective. This comparative literature review conjoins the seemingly disconnected literatures of HMC and sexuality studies (SeS) to explore questions surrounding intimacy, love, desire, sex, and sexuality among humans and machines. In particular, I argue for understanding human-machine sexualities as communicative sexuotechnical-assemblages, extending previous efforts in both HMC and SeS for more-than-human, ecological, and more fluid approaches to humans and machines, as well as to sex and sexuality. This essay continues and expands the critical turn in HMC by engaging in an interdisciplinary exercise with theoretical, design, and use/effect implications in the context of sex robots.

> *Contemporary academic discourse needs to move away from the idea of sexuality as a subject position, nicely and relatively stably wrapped under the epidermal cover of an individual human body, and develop instead a vocabulary about affective intensity, flux, and the sensual assembling of human and nonhuman elements into a pleasure machine.*—Lambevski, 2004, p. 305

For an introductory price of less than $10,000, interested customers may purchase “affordable” sex robots from Abyss Creations’ RealDoll, one of the leading manufacturers of sex robots. At the time of this writing, most sex robots consist of high-end sex dolls equipped with an artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced robotic head. Fully robotic sex bots are nonetheless in the works by many companies worldwide. The case of sex robots opens particularly interesting questions that reverberate across many domains of society, from companionship and intimacy to therapeutic usage and questions regarding the (il)legality of child sex dolls (e.g., Chatterjee, 2020). Opinions range from calls for abolishing sex robots (Campaign Against Porn Robots, n.d.1 ; Richardson, 2016a, 2016b) to heralding the many social and individual benefits (Levy, 2007a), with a broad range of opinions located somewhere between these extremes (e.g., Ess, 2018).

In this essay, I explore human-machine sexualities at the intersection of humanmachine communication (HMC) and sexuality studies (SeS). My aim in this essay is to engage in a comparative literature review that seeks to elaborate on the interdisciplinary intersections between the work in these two different fields, demonstrating how and why research on the subject of sex robots can inform work in HMC and how efforts in HMC can provide new insights for the study of sex robots, particularly from an SeS perspective. In doing so, I respond to Döring et al.’s (2020) call to increase the degree of theoretical elaboration of human-sex robot relations. With the arrival of interactive and communicative sex robots, I ponder the question, How can the bodies of literature in HMC and SeS enrich each other in the context of sex robots? In particular, by drawing on SeS in conjunction with HMC, I ask: In what ways do human-machine sexual relations alter our understanding of sexuality? What happens to our understanding of love and eroticism, intimacy and sexual closeness when the other is AI? In what ways does humans’ interaction with sex bots affect ontologizing processes, or the drawing of boundaries between humans and machines (Fortunati & Edwards, 2021)? In conjoining the emerging field of HMC with the rich, critical, and incoherent body of SeS, I punctuate how machines reconstitute sexualities and work the fuzzy edges in response to Hearn’s (2018) question, “what are the boundaries around [human] sexuality?” (p. 1368). More directly, what exactly constitutes the boundaries of human sexuality if the sexual partner is nonhuman?

This work continues earlier calls for mobilizing a critical perspective in HMC. Particularly in the realm of human-machine encounters where humans interact with machineothers in the creation of meaning (Fortunati & Edwards, 2020; Guzman, 2018), a critical communication perspective attunes us to the ways in which sociohistorical and cultural systems shape the ways in which humans make sense of machines (Dehnert & Leach, 2021). By turning to the rich context of human-machine sexualities and sex robots, I seek to further flesh out what a critical communication perspective to the study of machines and their co-creation of meaning with humans entails. In doing so, I argue that interdisciplinary approaches are necessary to fully capture the societal implications of machines, which I

In July of 2021, the organization formerly known as *Campaign Against Sex Robots announced its name change to Campaign Against Porn Robots* to reflect that, according to the campaign organizers, sexual activities involving robots are not “actual” sex but rather reflect processes of pornification and objectification (Campaign Against Porn Robots, n.d.; see also Danaher et al., 2017). The distinction between porn and sex related to robots seems to indicate the safeguarding of (human-to-human) notions of sex understood in the context of authenticity, intimacy, love, and connection, which are bypassed by the more-than-human framework of communicative sexuotechnical-assemblage put forth in this essay

demonstrate by bringing SeS in conversation with HMC. HMC offers a rich contextual framework for making sense of human-machine sexualities, and sex robots constitute an intriguing context for investigating the boundaries of machines as communicative others. By conjoining HMC and SeS, I investigate where one draws the boundaries between sex robots, sex toys, and other emerging technologies in the broader realm of the sexual and between (sex) robots and (a/sexual) humans.

As such, the main goal of this essay is to argue that the case of sex robots illustrates the necessity for critical approaches to human-machine relations (in HMC) and to sexuality (in SeS) writ large. I begin this argument by reviewing the ways in which machines are cast as communicative others and further outline the implications of a critical communication perspective to HMC. After I tentatively differentiate sex robots from other technologies, I specifically utilize interdisciplinary more-than-human approaches to both machines and sexuality, extending Flore and Pienaar’s (2020) notion of sexuotechnical-assemblage to describe the distinctly technological dimension of sexuality in human-machine relations. Further, by recasting sexuality as assemblage, I follow Fox and Alldred’s (2013) approach which “shifts the location of sexuality away from bodies and individuals, toward the affective flow within assemblages of bodies, things, ideas, and social institutions, and the (sexual) capacities produced in bodies by this flow” (p. 770). Conjoining this work, and thereby extending Martinez’s (2011) attention to communicative sexualities, I argue for describing human-machine sexualities as communicative sexuotechnical-assemblages. Finally, recasting sexuality in these geographic registers of relationality and assemblage responds to ongoing critiques of sexual science’s continued exclusion of and violence toward sexual others via pathologization (Flore, 2014), compounded colonization (Balestrery, 2012), and normalization (Irvine, 1990; Somerville, 1994). I conclude this essay with theoretical and design implications.
