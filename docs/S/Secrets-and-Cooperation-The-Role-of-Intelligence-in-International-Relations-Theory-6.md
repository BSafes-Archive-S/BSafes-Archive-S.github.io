## Achieving Security Cooperation Through Intelligence
Understanding the role of international relations theories is only a first step in determining courses of action that are in the best interest of the United States in achieving effective security and diplomatic cooperation initiatives. In order to advance its diplomatic efforts while leveraging intelligence, the United States ought to consider three additional approaches: harness the power of career diplomats in the intelligence decision-making process, formulate clear and direct strategic policies and initiatives in areas of intelligence sharing, and provide career diplomats and foreign service officers with necessary training, resources, and intelligence requirements to allow them to have better and more effective approaches to diplomacy. With these in mind, the intelligence community must also adapt, modernize, and be equipped to address emerging threats posed by malign activities in cyber, artificial intelligence, and social instability.

Diplomats offer a unique perspective into intelligence gaps that exist in the global environment. Their knowledge, skillset, and education are critical to achieving intelligence cooperation. Consider William J. Burns who currently serves as the director of the CIA. Prior to his current role, Burns served as the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a DC-based think tank of “diverse disciplines and perspectives” that seeks “to advance international peace” (https://carnegieendowment.org/about/). Director Burns, however, was not a career intelligence professional. Rather, his career was at the State Department. Throughout his thirty-three-year career in the foreign service, he served as Ambassador to Jordan in the Clinton Administration and Ambassador to Russia in the George W. Bush Administration. He held numerous senior positions at State along with the White House throughout his career as well before retiring in 2014. His appointment by President Joe Biden is significant for many reasons. First, as mentioned already, his career is in the foreign service. The Biden White House sees the importance of diplomacy in the IC and vice versa. Burns’ unique qualifications, skill set (he is fluent in Russian), and experience make him the ideal candidate to lead the CIA.

A great deal of conversation is taking place in the second decade of the twentieth century about the rise of Russia. The DOD and IC are increasingly worried that a more pragmatic and assertive Vladimir Putin is seeking new ways to undermine U.S. influence and alliances such as NATO. These concerns, however, are not new. When Bill Burns was Ambassador to Russia (2005-2008), he engaged with Putin on numerous occasions and observed that “Putin’s most striking characteristic was his passion for control—founded on an abiding distrust of most of those around him, whether in the Russian elite or among foreign leaders” (Burns, 2020, p. 206). This hunger for control by the Kremlin has only increased, and Vladimir Putin has “already begun to tilt in a more adversarial direction . . . persuaded that American-led international order was constraining Russia’s legitimate interests” (Burns, 2020, p. 209). What role then can the IC play to foster more cooperation between the United States and Russian governments?

This again points to Neoliberalism’s approach to institutional cooperation. The State Department, the Defense Department, and the Intelligence Community must have a common threat picture, identifying and addressing common intelligence gaps. In the right context, diplomacy acts as a solution as much as military force. Therefore, it is critical for career diplomats, like Bill Burns, to be in positions of leadership in the intelligence community. An intelligence threat assessment depends on regional knowledge, a top skill that diplomats possess. Individuals with a background in the foreign service also possess relationships with their foreign counterparts, relationships that are valuable in achieving cooperation in areas with intelligence equities and requirements. The 2018 National Defense Strategy of the United States addresses the need for cooperation to achieve regional and global security. “Our allies and partners provide complementary capabilities and forces along with unique perspectives, regional relationships, and information that improve our understanding of the environment and expand our options” (Department of Defense, 2018, p. 8). Intelligence professionals with a diplomatic background, therefore, enhance the United States’ ability to meet cooperation initiatives while at the same time meeting national defense priorities.

Intelligence sharing with international partners will strengthen and enhance both the United States’ ability to address emerging security challenges, but also those of its allies. To this end, intelligence agencies, along with the Geographic Combatant Commands (GCCs) of the Defense Department must put in place strategic initiatives and policies to allow for this type of cooperation to not only exist but also thrive. Now that the United States is engaged in Great Power Competition with near-peer adversaries such as China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, it should be expected that such competition will require intel cooperation among agencies and international partners, while not dismissing mil-to-mil or economic cooperation. McGruddy (2013) described the mutual benefit of this approach, “Intelligence collaboration occurs when both sides can see potential benefits, be it from gaining information that helps complete the jigsaw, reducing the need for expensive surveillance in other countries, or more recently, less developed nations gaining precious aid resources” (p. 214). Strategic policies in intel sharing will assist in guiding the United States’ approach to GPC.

Broad intelligence sharing agreements and policies are created mostly by the IC and DOD. Current policies, directives, and Executive Orders are implemented down to the GCCs, with oversight from the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD-I). Among the responsibilities tasked by DOD Directive 5143.01, OUSD (I) is responsible for “Establish[ing] and maintain[ing] Defense Intelligence relationships and Defense Intelligence exchange programs with selected cooperative foreign defense establishments, intelligence or security services of foreign governments, and international organizations, in coordination with the USD(P)” (Department of Defense, 2020, p. 6). Intelligence sharing policies and initiatives, therefore, can create partnerships in areas of academia, diplomacy, and foreign aid. Combatant Commanders must not only reply on military cooperation initiatives to achieve their regional security objectives, but also on intel sharing.

Diplomacy requires a great amount of training in cultural awareness, foreign language, and policies. One asset that would further their diplomatic efforts to achieve security and other forms of cooperation is continued training in intelligence. Knowledge in intelligence oversight, counterintelligence, and intel sharing assists those in diplomatic posts in conducting their missions. This training is offered via several methods, to include online virtual, in person classroom, in the field, in a military garrison setting, or in a residency capacity at a school or university. Courses in vast areas of intelligence is provided by not only the State Department, but also by the DIA’s Joint Military Attaché School or various other programs by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency.

Intelligence training is not the only resource diplomats or foreign service officers need to accomplish security and diplomatic cooperation initiatives. The role of liaison officers (LNOs) is also critical. LNOs may be from other agencies, legislative aides from Capitol Hill, or military officers, both U.S. and international, with a diverse service background. They represent their organizations to a host nation and act as a point person to their assigned organization. LNOs are advocates, expressing the needs, desires, and intentions of the nation which they represent. Neoliberalism encourages these partnerships to accomplish national objectives. IR theory—no matter the type—places an important amount of stress and focus on a state’s credibility to leverage its resources to achieve policy objectives. Training and adequate resources, thus, allow for state actors to have the ability to pursue their own national interests in a credible way.

Another key resource in intelligence cooperation is professional military education (PME). Exchange programs between nations allow for joint exercises, drills, and cultural proficiency. Just like training in intel, this training is also able to be administered in many ways. PME does not necessarily have to be tactical in nature. An example of this is international field grade officers attending the Army War College or Naval Postgraduate School, earning Graduatelevel degrees in strategic studies or strategic intelligence. Utilizing the power of education is something that is central to any IR theory. Being well-rounded and well-read allows military officers, diplomats, and policy makers to make better-informed ideas and approaches to sensitive-level decisions. It allows for lessons of the past to be studied and analyzed and the outlook to be discussed and debated. A changing global environment and threat picture in the twenty-first century only underscores the importance of PME in security cooperation.
