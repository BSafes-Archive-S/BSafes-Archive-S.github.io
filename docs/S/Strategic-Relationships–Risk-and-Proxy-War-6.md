## The Contractual Model—Mercenaries and other Guns for Hire
The contractual model is perhaps one of the oldest relational models between principal and agent. This model carries such historic significance that Niccolò Machiavelli makes mention of it in his classic political and military treatise, The *Prince*. <sup>58</sup> In the contractual model, the principal subcontracts the work of warfighting to an existing firm or business that possesses the military means to obtain the principal’s goals.

Contractual proxies afford several benefits to the principal. First, it increases the distance between the principal and the horrors of war, thus decreasing its domestic and political risk. Second, contractual proxies negate the deployment of large military formations, thereby increasing operational secrecy and deniability. Third, contractual proxies are a quick and easy way to get quasi-military forces on the ground, increasing the principal’s tactical options and hastening its response time.

Contractual proxies loom large in modern wars in the Middle East. Companies such as *MPRI, Aegis, Blackwater*, and *Triple Canopy* became household names during the early years of American-led Operation Iraqi Freedom. Personnel from these companies were found fighting alongside U.S. military personnel. One example, 2004’s battle of Najaf, saw *Blackwater* personnel help turn the tide of battle in favor of the U.S. Army and Marines with whom they were fighting. <sup>59</sup> In March 2004, the murder of four *Blackwater* personnel provided the impetus for the First and Second Battles of Fallujah, which burned hot through the remainder of 2004.<sup>60</sup> Later, in 2007, *Blackwater* was involved in the indiscriminate killing of more than 20 Iraqis in Baghdad’s Mansour Square. The slaughter stoked the fire of an increasingly deadly and out of control insurgency, further complicating the American mission in Iraq. <sup>61</sup> Rebranded several times since its troublesome days in Iraq, *Blackwater* and its head, Erik Prince, continue to offer contractual proxy solutions to state-based problems in armed conflict, as his 2018 push to privatize the war in Afghanistan illustrates.<sup>62</sup>

Russia’s *Wagner Group* is the most visible example of this model today. A brief battle with American Special Forces and SDF proxies in February 2018 at Dier ez-Zor, Syria pulled the *Wagner Group* out of the shadows and thrust it into the international community’s watchful eyes. The battle was short, lasting only a few hours, but savage, resulting in the death of over 200 *Wagner* contractors.<sup>63</sup>

*Wagner*’s employment extends well beyond the Syrian desert. The group is reported to operate in Ukraine, South America, and Africa; however, its reach is likely broader than that.<sup>64</sup> The arrest of 33 *Wagner* contractors during the height of political upheaval in Belarus on July 29, 2020 is a clear indication of this broader reach.<sup>65</sup>

The Taliban in Afghanistan offer another example of how contractual proxies are employed. Russia and Iran, looking to further bog down the United States in Afghanistan, and continue to discredit America’s ability to effectively manage the Afghan war, are both guilty of enlisting the Taliban to serve as a proxy on its behalf. In the summer of 2020, reports surfaced that both Russia, through its intelligence service the GRU, and Iran, through several Kabul-based front companies, paid bounties to the Taliban and its associates to kill American and NATO soldiers.<sup>66</sup> The Taliban— Russia and Iran’s de facto proxy—allowed both countries to wage a lowscale, low-cost proxy war against the United States and NATO in Afghanistan.

The bond between principal and agent in a contractual relationship is high because the proxy would not accept the contract if it were uncomfortable with the agreement’s inherent risk, nor would the principal hire the agent if it were not willing to assume a high degree of risk. Nevertheless, the dyad possesses a two-hold decoupling point. A contractual proxy will distance itself or nullify the contract if it finds itself butting up upon existential crisis. Second, the principal will nullify the agreement if that proxy’s presence cuts against the principal’s strategic goals. The Wagner Group and *Blackwater* illustrate these concepts. Wagner’s defeat at Deir ez-Zor is within a contractual proxy’s capacity to absorb.<sup>67</sup> However, situations such as *Blackwater*’s continued presence in Iraq following its slaughter of innocent Iraqis in Baghdad’s Mansour Square, increase strategic risk for both partners to the point in which the relationship is toxic for both partners, and must be culled. <sup>68</sup>
