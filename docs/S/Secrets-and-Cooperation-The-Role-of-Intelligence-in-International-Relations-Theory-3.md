## Classic Realism
This theory in international relations asserts that nation states exist for their own self interests. Realists place their focus and attention on domestic affairs but view international conflicts as areas to avoid. They do not believe that it is in their self-interest to be involved, whether financially or militarily, in a prolonged conflict, especially if the end state is unclear. Jütersonke (2010) wrote, “In international relations theory, Realism posits that international politics involves self-interested actors operating in a self-help system with no overreaching authority” (Jütersonke, p. 5). One of the most notable Realists in history is Hans J. Morgenthau (1904-1980) who taught that “First, that for theoretical purposes, international relations is identical with international politics; second, that a theory of international politics is but a specific instance of a general theory of politics.” Here, Morgenthau is teaching that IR theory and IR politics go together. Realists ought to know the international system to participate in it effectively.

Doyle and Ikenberry (1997) wrote about the central figure in Classic Realism as “the fundamental unit of political organization for the past several centuries has been, and at the present it is, the nation state” (p. 164). These two authors support what Jütersonke writes, and they hold the same assumptions. Given these basic facts on Realism, domestic security would be a product of a nation state that has self-interests. No matter their democratic status, most world leaders want their nation to be safe and secure. Thus, gathering and analyzing intelligence achieves the objectives of having a secure nation. Nations, in their own self-interests, will not only mobilize whatever military resources they have at their disposal, but also intelligence assets and capabilities. Is Realism, however, the most effective IR theory that promotes the use of intelligence?

To answer this question, it is important to analyze the relationships nations have when it comes to intelligence sharing and not just joint military training, exercises, or drills. With emerging threats becoming more complex, the exchange of intel capabilities and resources among global allies will become more necessary. As such, the Realist school of IR theory approaches partnerships with caution. Dunne et al. (2016) pointed out that Morgenthau “[understood] politics as a struggle for power and unilateral advantage.” Additionally, they wrote that Realism is cautious of partnerships, but not entirely dismissive, because “military capability and alliances are necessary safeguards in the rough-and-tumble world of international relations but cannot be counted on to preserve the peace or the independence of actors” (p. 40). Much of this skepticism came out of World War II. In the years following the war, the European continent was healing and building back from decades of monarchial rule and dictatorships. The United States played a significant role in rebuilding Europe, but it took years longer for relationships to be made. It is no surprise that when nation states take up their own cause—often a misguided one as Germany and Italy learned in World War II—on their own with little regard to the consequences, alliances and partnerships will often not last, and cooperation will be hard to achieve. Intelligence is a crucial asset, and therefore, that valuable information is only able to be obtained through lasting partnerships that will require frequent attention and nurturement. 

Being hesitant of intel sharing among allies is a major weakness in the Realist theory. This is viewed by Pashakhanlou (2017) as a “security dilemma” (p. 519). There is only one solution, and it is easier said than done. “To overcome this condition, states must accurately gauge and reassure one another of their benign intentions” (Pashakhanlou, p. 520). Some partnerships will take longer to foster than others. Nation states must not only have the will to engage in security cooperation, but also the resources. DeVine (2019) stressed that it is not only in the United States’ best interest for enhanced security cooperation through intelligence, but also the nation with which the United States is attempting to cooperate. “U.S. intelligence relations with foreign counterparts offer a number of benefits: indications and warning of an attack, expanded geographic coverage, corroboration of national sources, accelerated access to a contingency area, and a diplomatic backchannel” (DeVine, p. 1). Realism, therefore, provides fair and well-thought points on the role of intelligence in national objectives, but falls short in international cooperation to confront like adversaries and security challenges.
