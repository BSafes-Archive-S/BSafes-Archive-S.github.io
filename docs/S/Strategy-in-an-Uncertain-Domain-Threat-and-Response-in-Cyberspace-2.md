## The Congested Grey Zone and Cyber Uncertainty
According to a former senior United Kingdom cyber official: “There have been more than 200 acts popularly portrayed as state-on-state cyberattacks. Most have been a combination of espionage, media influence, economic coercion, and political intervention, deliberately calibrated below the legal threshold for an act of aggression that would justify an armed response, and therefore in the grey zone between peace and war.” <sup>4</sup> The acceleration and intensification of this threat is global, but it is experienced differently depending on the strategic situation of a given state. The most capable state actors have developed offensive cyber capabilities and integrated these into existing defence and intelligence communities, such as U.S. Cyber Command or the United Kingdom’s recently avowed National Cyber Force.<sup>5</sup>

Competition and conflict between states manifests a particular character in the cyber domain. However, the nature of inter-state competition and conflict is enduring, channelling the Clausewitzian distinction between the character and nature of war. It is shaped by rival claims and objectives, the fundamentally agonistic feature of which arguably defines the concept of the political. <sup>6</sup> As such, it is unsurprising that the first reported decades of cyber operations can be seen to have followed settled lines of interstate competition and conflict, as well as conforming to the on-going ‘global war on terrorism’ in the case of coalition cyber operations against Daesh.

The article uses case study analysis to illustrate the problem of cyber uncertainty, focusing on the cyber operations against Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine in 2016. These operations were consistent with the policies pursued overtly by the Russian Federation during ongoing bilateral tensions and/or specific periods of armed conflict with the victim states. Even so, the Russian state denied responsibility, shifted blame and tried to spread doubt about the identity of the culprits— signature traits of the “heavily contested information environment” surrounding cyber attribution. <sup>7</sup> Such operations inhabit a congested grey zone of competition and conflict between states and non-state actors. <sup>8</sup> Whether the resultant deniability is widely perceived as plausible or implausible, covert action has long been employed by states to interfere in the affairs of other states; cyber capabilities are merely the latest chapter in this history, amplifying a state’s options for covert action. <sup>9</sup> The deeply technical nature of the domain and the complexity of the forensic analysis necessary to determine attribution, creates asymmetries of knowledge and understanding, exacerbating existing fissures between states and across the global public sphere. This additional layer of cyber uncertainty complicates the decisions facing victim states and their allies in how to respond to cyber operations.<sup>10</sup>

Uncertainty is exacerbated by states’ use of proxies and cut-outs. <sup>11</sup> It is amplified further by possibility of false flag operations and deliberate misdirection. It has been reported that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had developed anti-forensics tools, for example by applying nonEnglish language settings (including Russian and Korean) to its malware. <sup>12</sup> Similarly, a Russian intelligence agency reportedly conducted a cyber operation against the 2018 Winter Olympics, unsuccessfully trying to implicate North Korea as the perpetrator.<sup>13</sup> Without the forensic tools possessed by major cyber and intelligence powers such as the United States, or by the most capable threat intelligence companies—and potentially even with such expertise—the attribution of cyber operations can be a difficult, time-consuming process. And given the arcane, exclusive nature of attribution, and the polluted, contested nature of the global information environment, legitimating attribution judgements in the global public sphere is a significant challenge for public diplomacy.

Social, economic, and political life increasingly depends on and is shaped by digital technologies. This is also the case for inter-state competition and conflict: Contesting narratives through digital diplomacy and subversive disinformation operations; the increasingly online activities of intelligence agencies, armed services and aligned non-state actors, achieving effects in and through cyberspace. Contemporary multi-domain operations entail a cyber dimension. <sup>14</sup> And strategically, actors employ cyber operations for compellence and dissuasion, although efficacy is contested. <sup>15</sup> Given the complexity of physical and virtual layers that constitute cyberspace, identifying a cyber operation and attributing it to a specific culprit is an effort requiring different levels of analysis and is likely to rely on cyber forensic equities in both the state and private sectors. Where investigating states possess significant intelligence capabilities, it is possible that human and signals intelligence reporting might contribute to the totality of evidence supporting attribution analysis, providing insights into the technical operational practices of the alleged culprit (state or non-state) actor or into elite decisions authorizing such cyber operations. <sup>16</sup>

Where such sophisticated, composite capabilities for attribution analyses are absent, or else insufficient, attribution is often guided by lowerconfidence, *cui bono* logic and/or by the receipt of attribution analyses shared by more cyber-capable states. In the latter case, there is a question of trust potentially exacerbated by information asymmetry: Is attribution assessment shared simply as a global public good, or to further the foreign policy objectives of the sharing state(s)? Following cui bono logic in the absence of other information, having explored the relevant geopolitical context, the actor most likely to benefit from the operation might plausibly be regarded as a potential perpetrator. <sup>17</sup> Indeed, unless the cyber operation is purely retributive and destructive, the instrumentality of the operation as a compellent or deterrent action arguably relies on the victim correctly inferring the culprit’s true identity and intent. <sup>18</sup> Consequently, it has been observed that cyber operations more often focus on degrading adversary capabilities than on achieving compellence or dissuasion. <sup>19</sup>

Cyber operations against state and non-state targets instrumentalize uncertainty in the pursuit of national (and sometimes simply acquisitive and criminal) objectives. Deniability, however implausible, is particularly important from the perspective of international law and the prospect of being held accountable. <sup>20</sup> The absence of dispositive evidence of a culprit’s identity complicates a victim state’s decision process, calling into doubt the basis for retaliatory or other responses.
