## Conclusion
With most thought and reflections on sex robots being confined to speculation at this time, this essay serves as a contribution to the ongoing, important debates on sex robots by conjoining two seemingly disconnected bodies of literature—HMC and SeS. Ongoing interdisciplinary work is needed as scholars make sense of current and future technological advancements in the realm of the sexual. I have specifically called for and extended efforts in the critical theorizing of sex robots in particular, and machines writ large. Questions regarding intimacy, love, sex, and desire have occupied humans for thousands of years. Reconceptualizing sex robots in the realm of human-machine sexualities, or communicative sexuotechnical-assemblages, allows for addressing the ways in which affective flows between humans and machines constitute sexuality, as well as recognizing the ways in which notions of sex and sexuality are always tied to larger, deterritorialized systems of meaning. Current and emerging technologies such as teledildonics, AI, and physical sex robots offer vibrant potential for sex and sexuality, lying somewhere between utopian hopes for orgasmic frenzies and dystopian fears of sterile and stale numbing down. The boundaries of (human) sexuality are broad, fringy, messy, and oftentimes unclear. This is even more so the case as technology, and in particular sex robots, become increasingly entangled in human sexual relations.
