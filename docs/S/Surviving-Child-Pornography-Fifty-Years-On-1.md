## AUTHOR BIOGRAPHY
**Jeanette Westbrook**, MSSW, is a social worker and human rights activist and defender with over 27 years of experience. As a social worker, I have years of frontline experience working with traumatized clients from around the world, many of whom were victims of war, torture, incest, prostitution, and rape. I have worked for 20 years with people convicted of drug and alcohol offenses, assault, robbery, trafficking, and pimping in Kentucky court-ordered programs. She is the first co-chair of the Louisville, Kentucky, Human Trafficking Task Force and the former president and vice-president of the United Nations Association of USAKentucky. She is a member of SPACE International—an international organization advocating for the worldwide adoption of the Nordic Model. She has presented on over 30 panels at the United Nations. She has used her experience as a survivor to advocate for international treaties and policies that facilitate the empowerment of women and girls.
