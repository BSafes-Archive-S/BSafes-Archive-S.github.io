## Thesis
Accurate, credible, and timely intelligence allows policy makers, senior military leaders, and heads of state make informed decisions on matters of national security, use of force, and formulating plans to compete with strategic threats. Intelligence collection, production, and analysis accomplishes these objectives. This paper seeks to analyze the role intelligence plays in various International Relations (IR) theories and how the application of intelligence assists nation states in achieving their own objectives. Not only will this paper examine specific IR theories, but also historical events and noteworthy intelligence professionals and diplomats who have shown throughout their careers how to apply these truths to their work. Finally, this paper will outline the ways in which world leaders today—especially those who wish to promote democracy and preserve peace—ought to move forward in a time of global competition. Solving security challenges in a post-COVID-19 world will require an innovative approach, and global competitors are not waiting.
