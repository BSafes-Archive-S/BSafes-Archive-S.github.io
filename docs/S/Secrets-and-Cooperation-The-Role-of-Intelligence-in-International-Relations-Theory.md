The role of intelligence in achieving military, economic, or other forms of objectives is not a new concept. Sun Tzu was an ancient Chinese military general and strategist, scholar, and philosopher who lived 2,500 years ago during the Zhou Dynasty. In The Art of War, his most famous work, he wrote that “advance knowledge cannot be gained from ghosts and spirits, inferred from phenomena, or projected from the measures of heaven, but must be gained from men for it is the knowledge of the enemy’s true situation” (Tzu, 5th Century BC; Sawyer & Sawyer, 1994, p. 231). He was writing about the value of intelligence and went on to describe diverse types of spies that military commanders can deploy to learn as much about the enemy as possible. Has intelligence lost its value in the last 2,500 years? The short answer is no. Rather, it is important to not only military leaders today, but also to diplomats, policy makers, and international organizations. As Pashakhanlou (2017) put it, “The ways in which intelligence has been conducted does…vary across time and space and the procedures are often radically different in the Information Age from previous epochs” (p. 521).

The second decade of the twenty-first century is one with unique challenges that the United States and the world has never endured. China is on the rise, becoming bolder and more ambitious in its quest for economic and military dominance. Russia is actively undermining democracies around the world and seeking to weaken alliances on the European continent, while supporting brutal dictatorships with a clear desire to become a great power once again. Iran poses a security challenge to the United States and its allies through its nuclear program, while North Korea also continues to challenge U.S. policies and international law by testing nuclear weapons. This new age of Great Power Competition (GPC) requires more than military action. To achieve a strategic edge against its adversaries and counter malign influence, the United States and its global allies must leverage the extensive capabilities of the Intelligence Community to drive decision making not only as it relates to military use of force, but also diplomacy and efforts to promote cooperation—both security and economic—among nation states.
