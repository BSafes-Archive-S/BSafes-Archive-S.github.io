## Definitions, Terms of Reference, and Framing Proxy Relationships 
Proxy war and its associated ideas and terms are contested concepts. As a result, no standard exists in which to point to guide proxy war discussions. In the absence of an accepted set of concepts and lexicon, those listed within this section are the standard used throughout this work.

Proxy war is a broad taxonomy of armed conflict, not a discrete form or type of warfighting. Broadly associating one form of warfighting with proxy war demonstrates intellectual laziness and is not useful in making sense of the phenomena. While proxy wars fight be fought through partisans or insurgents as irregular wars or insurgencies, this is not the only way in which these types of wars are fought. Russia’s rapacious hybrid campaign in eastern Ukraine, which heavily relied on conventional combat operations, stresses this point. The war’s Donbas Campaign, which birthed the violent, bloody, and destructive battles of Ilovaisk, Donetsk Airport, Luhansk Airport, and Debal’tseve, has resulted in 13,200 Ukrainian dead and 30,000 wounded since the war began in the spring of 2014.<sup>10</sup> This is a clear signal that today’s proxy wars are more than just state-sponsored insurgencies waged in political hinterlands, but instead can fall anywhere along the continuum of conflict.A proxy war’s form or method of warfighting is subject to each participant’s political narrative, preference, objectives, and resources. The principal, on the other hand, is constrained by the narratives, objectives, and resource limitations of its chosen agent, and the bond that exists between it and its surrogate.

Equally important, proxies must not be taken entirely as non-state actors. Proxy forces, based upon the type of principal-agent dyad, can span the spectrum from state armies fighting as surrogates for a benefactor, to proto-state forces fighting for international legitimation, to partisan groups cobbled together by an actor to do its tactical dirty work. Nevertheless, the group identity of the actor filling the role of proxy is not as important as the type of relationship between the principal and the proxy. The relationship’s character is the glue that bonds the two actors into a singular whole.

Moreover, a proxy war is one in which two or more actors, working against a common adversary, strive to achieve a common objective.<sup>11</sup> This dyad is governed by a principal-agent reciprocation, time, and power dynamics. See Figure 1, Proxy Environment. Within the dyad, the principal actor operates indirectly, through another actor—an agent, surrogate, interlocutor, or proxy—to accomplish its strategic objective or curate its strategic interests. By virtue of working on behalf of the principal, whether willfully or by coercive means, the principal’s objectives become that of the surrogate actor. <sup>12</sup> As theorists Carl von Clausewitz and B.H. Liddell Hart note, problems of risk-sharing and agency accompany a principal-agent dyad. According to Carl von Clausewitz, “One country may support another’s cause, but will never take it as serious as it takes its own.”<sup>13</sup> Meanwhile, Liddell Hart posits that, “No agreement between governments has had any stability beyond their recognition that it is in their own interest to adhere to it.”<sup>14</sup>

Professor Kathleen Eisenhardt suggests that these problems arise when the ambition or aims of the two actors become misoriented or come into conflict with each other. <sup>15</sup> Additionally, Eisenhardt contends that this occurs when the actor’s attitudes and acceptance of risk are misaligned.<sup>16</sup> In turn, risk’s impact on the relationship tends to result in dyad divergence as contact with risk continues. <sup>17</sup>

Recent work on proxy war suggests that two models of relationship exist within proxy war—transactional and exploitative models. <sup>18</sup> Current proxy war research argues that these two models do not fully articulate the character of relationships in proxy environments. Analysis focused on risk, commitment, investment cost, and strategic interaction amongst partners instead suggests that five relationship models subsist within proxy war. These models—exploitative, coercive, cultural, contractual and transactional—provide the policymaker, strategist, practitioner, and historian useful tools for making sense of proxy war. Furthermore, understanding risk, and how it can be manipulated to accelerate or decelerate divergence within a principal-agent dyad, can further assist those interested or involved in proxy wars.
