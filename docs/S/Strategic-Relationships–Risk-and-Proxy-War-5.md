## The Cultural Model—Cousins and Like-Minded Believers Working Together
Writing in his classic work, *A History of Warfare*, historian John Keegan breaks free of the shackles of Clausewitzian thought, focused on war being a political endeavor, and instead forces the reader to address the relationship between culture and war. Breaking ranks with Clausewitz, Keegan argues, “War embraces much more than politics: that it is always an expression of culture, often a determinant of cultural form, in some societies the culture itself.”<sup>47</sup> Keegan’s position is the starting point for understanding proxy war’s cultural principal-agent relationship. Because culture is rooted in self-identity, cultural bonds in a principal-proxy dyad are extremely strong, forming an abiding relationship.

As the history of war and international competition shows, cultural connections often exist beyond the limits of the political map. The major features of culture—religion, ethnicity, and language—as well as geographic precedence are often used as leverage to generate proxies in heterogeneous areas where proxy wars materialize. Cultural proxies are the result of a principal actor tapping into existing cultural demographics to obtain power and influence over a group of individuals. Russia’s use of culturally similar groups in eastern Ukraine to build a proxy government and proxy army are a useful illustration of this model.

For much of its history, Ukraine has been part of Russia, either in part or in whole. Because of that relationship with Russia Ukraine differs greatly from west to east. Western Ukraine is predominately ethnic Ukrainian, Catholic, and heavily populated with Ukrainian speakers. Eastern Ukraine, on the other hand, carries the legacy of imperial Russia. Many portions of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas belonged to Imperial Russia throughout the rule of the Romanov czars. As recent as 1922, the Novorossiya region of Ukraine—Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, Odessa, Zaporizhia, and Mykolaiv— belonged to Russia, while Crimea did not become part of Ukraine until 1954. <sup>48</sup> Resultantly, much of the eastern expanse of Ukraine, to include its border with Russia, is populated by ethnic Russians, Russophones, and Eastern Orthodox Christians who are intermixed with Catholic, Ukrainianspeaking ethnic Ukrainians.<sup>49</sup>

Under the Romanov dynasty the czars stylized their holdings, of which Ukraine was a centerpiece, as All Russias. Cleverly manipulating historical precedent and geographic pedigree, Russian President Vladimir Putin used the All Russias and Novorossiya concepts to legitimize the Kremlin’s political and military ambitions in Ukraine. <sup>50</sup> To be sure, during the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war’s outset, Putin and foreign minister Sergey Lavrov often employed the term Novorossiya and its historical lineage within the All Russias framework to justify Russian aggression in Ukraine.<sup>51</sup> As part of this advocacy, Putin and Lavrov said it was Russia’s right to protect ethnic Russians, Russophones, and Eastern Orthodox Christians abroad, to include those in Ukraine. <sup>52</sup> In sum, Russia made use of history, geography, and cultural demographics to cultivate sympathetic supporters in Ukraine to build proxy governments and proxy armies to combat Kyiv.

Moving to the Middle East, Iran provides an excellent case study for this model too. Iran uses cultural ties, generally the Shiite branch of Islam, to build strong-bonded proxies throughout the Middle East. Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Iraq’s Kata’ib Hezbollah are Iran’s most notable proxies across the Shia Crescent, while it also supports the Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hamas, and a host of Shia militia groups in Syria and Iraq.<sup>53</sup> Iran’s Quds Force, a keystone feature within Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, is the prime mover for its proxies. The Quds Force provides funding, support, and advisors to its proxies, in addition to strategic and tactical planning. <sup>54</sup>

As Kata’ib Hezbollah in Iraq demonstrates, cultural bonds between principal and proxy are strong and result in the proxy willing to share high degrees of risk with their principal. <sup>55</sup> Since its inception following the 2003 American-led invasion of Iraq, Kata’ib Hezbollah has provoked and fought the United States, directly and indirectly, on behalf of Iran. <sup>56</sup> Further, the group’s continued resistance to American interests in Iraq following the assassination of its leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in January 2020, demonstrates that cultural proxies tend to stick by their principal despite increasing levels of risk. <sup>57</sup>
