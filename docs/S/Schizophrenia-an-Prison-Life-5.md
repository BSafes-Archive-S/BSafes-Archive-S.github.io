## Difficulties in gathering data and life adaptation in individuals with Schizophrenia
There is a suggestion that prisoners that are mentally ill (this includes those with schizophrenia) do not integrate well into prison life. Individuals with schizophrenia often behave in a disruptive and difficult manner, through no fault of their own. Experience and reports that arose from treating these individuals with mental illness suggests and is consistent with the assumption that these particular inmates do not adapt well (Morgan, et al. 1993). Mentally Ill inmates, including schizophrenic ones appear to remain incarcerated far longer than inmates who are not. They may present difficulties in understanding rules and regulations, thus increasing their stay behind bars as they proceed to violate more rules due to their mental illness. Studies presented on this matter state that jail inmates were twice as likely (19% versus 9%) to be charged with facility rule violations and mentally ill inmates accounted for 41% of infractions even though they constituted only 19% of the prison population (Office of Research and Public Affairs, 2016).

Paranoid Schizophrenics are not uncommon within jails and prisons, and this could hinder accessibility as the individual may refuse to participate not only in studies but also become uncooperative as well. Collecting and measuring data becomes nearly impossible, as the subject is unwilling due to their disorder. The evidence comes to light when 31% of inmates who were asked to participate within a study blatantly refused cooperation, a trait that is part of many individuals who have paranoid schizophrenia (Office of Research and Public Affairs, 2016). In working with these types of individuals, difficulties arise and collecting/measuring data becomes near impossible or blocked if the subjects refuse to participate.
