## 3. Applications of IoT in various fields
A survey has been done based on 270 responses from 31 countries to solve day-to- day problems on various fields such as Smart home, Smart city, Retail, Agriculture, smart Factory, Supply Chain, Healthcare, User Interaction, Environment and Energy, etc. In this part we discussed briefly on IoT Applications in Medical (health care), Smart Home, Smart cities, Agriculture and Education which is also shown in Figure 4.

### A. IoT in Medical Application
Due to growing population, rural urbanization, ageing population, economic growth and socially unbalanced resource utilization, some problems [some social problems] in the health care f have become increasingly apparent Due to rapid growth in diseases and inadequate healthcare facilities, numbers of patients are increasing. Elderly people with multiple diseases are suffering, which has turned to be a serious social issue

- In rural areas, lack of medical facilities, limited medical staff, and inadequate health care system, and shortage of institutional facilities has become a major issue to avail medical services as well as people’s Livelihood [12]. 

- Because the national strategy to protect the health of citizens is taking long time to be implemented, a heavy burden is placed on the economy, individuals, families, and states. 

- Inadequate disease prevention and early detection capability [2].

To solve the above issues, IoT play a vital role to improve the health care system in society irrespective of location, time, and user’s activity. The Remote Monitoring and Management platform of Health care information (RMMP-HI), can improve quality of human life by performing some basic tasks such as a sensor that can be placed in patient’s body and collect information regarding the healthcare of the patient and transmit information to internet making the important health information available to doctors, family members of the patient and others who opted to get it. It is also used to monitor patient’s current medicine and assess the expected health hazards against new medicine in terms of any allergic and other reaction. A person’s body temperature, heart beat and blood pressure can also be tracked by the help of the sensors and technology used in IoT [3]. In the recent years, IoT has been received a substantial attention to fight against infectious diseases, i.e. COVID-19. This disease has similar symptoms like normal cough and fever. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is addressed in following phases such as early diagnosis, quarantine time [30].

In the early diagnosis phase, a patient needs faster diagnosis due to contagiousness nature of the disease. So, it is important to diagnose the patient as soon as possible to prevent the virus from spreading. Devices such as sensors are used in this phase to detect and capture information about patient’s health condition, including body temperature and taking blood samples from suspicious cases. The next phase is called as quarantine phase, where he or she requires being isolated for a particular period of time depending on the patient’s age and infected condition; it may take 14 days or more. During this period, a patient may be monitored remotely with the help of IoT device for treatment. In this current Pandemic situation, the IoT technology has been proved to be a safe and efficient method of detecting and treating with COVID -19 [13].

### B. IoT in smart Home
Now a day, smart home is termed as a residence where the telecommunication networks interconnect essential home appliances, to provide proactive services such as monitoring light, room temperature, humidity, and reduce cost against the communication technology, information technology and electronics. Home automation controls all the function and features of smart home automatically by using one or more computer. The main aim of this system is to enhance the quality of life, reduce operating costs and optimize the energy consumption and also windows, doors Air conditioning as well as Refrigerator, washing machine can manipulate and control by remote platform and programs [5].

### C. IoT in Design of Smart Cities
It is possible to design smart cities using the Internet of Things (IoT) e.g. monitoring traffic and air quality, discovering emergency routes, efficient lighting up of the city, watering gardens, etc. [5]. People in this current day require a smart system. Users must perform their tasks intelligently. They are looking for such user-friendly programme that would allow them to do item monitoring, home security, handling various appliances, workspaces, and so on. Object tracking refers to the tracking of various user objects such as smart phones, monitoring things using Global Positioning System (GPS), and so on.

### D. IoT in Agriculture
Farmers find it difficult to check the soil's PH, nutrition, humidity, and other parameters on a regular basis. The temperature of the green house can become unpredictable at times, resulting in poor plant growth or death. In this case, IoT will automatically check the PH value, nutrition value, amount of humidity in the soil, and so on, and will supply the necessary nutrients to the soil or plants as needed. IoT can also monitor the temperature of the green house and automatically set the temperatures that are appropriate for the plants. IoT can also monitor the water quality provided for plantation purposes [20]. It can also provide the necessary amount of fertilizer for various plants. IoT may be used on both the ground and in the air. In the bottom level, IoT devices can readily identify crop health, crop length, insects if any are detected in the crops, toxins collected at the roots of the plants, and so on.

### E. IoT in Education
Smart education refers to the use of smart technologies to teach students in a way that not only attracts kids to learn new things but also allows individual students to learn according to their comprehension standards. By reducing costs, IoT enables students to learn new and inventive things. It not only benefits the students, but it also allows academicians and administrators to quickly manage the students and respond to or provide feedback on their performance [31].

The development of smart boards or digital boards entices students to combine photos, videos, audios, and other media to facilitate their learning process. The digital boards are so efficient, both electronically and technologically, that they make it easier for kids to learn new topics. Students used to digitally design posters, change existing ones, share such files to anyone, and so on. The concept of interactive learning through various applications assists students in analyzing problems and finding solutions. These interactive movies are so effective that kids may comprehend any topic with ease.
