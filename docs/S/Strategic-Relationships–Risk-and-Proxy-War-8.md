## Risk in Proxy War
This survey of relationships in proxy war reveals that risk is the glue that binds a proxy dyad, but risk is equally the wedge issue to separate actors in a principal-proxy relationship. Both tactical and strategic risk affect the relationship in different ways. The impact is dependent on the dyad’s bond and on the character, or type of relationship between the principal and agent. While not scientific because it is nearly impossible to measure intangibles such as commitment, it is useful to identify the relative strength and weakness of proxy partnerships based upon their tolerance for tactical and strategic risk. Doing so provides a useful model for further examining and forecasting proxy wars.

Risk also stimulates the transition between a short-term and long-term proxy war. If tested, coerced, contractual, and transactional proxy relationships will unravel far quicker than exploitative or cultural proxy relationships when presented with moderate to high levels of existential or strategic risk.<sup>77</sup> This is because the coupling in the first three models is not as tight as that found in the latter two.<sup>78</sup> Exploitative or cultural relationships tend to continue longer because they are willing to carry higher degrees of risk than the other three models.

Risk, serving as a proxy relationship’s exploitable cleft, can be used to separate and defeat a proxy relationship. Proxy relationships can be addressed in a similar manner to the Napoleonic strategy of central position. By that, an actor seeks to separate, or maintained dispersion between converging forces, in order to fight one adversary at a time, and thus, defeat the opponents in detail.<sup>79</sup> Bonaparte’s employment of the flexible corps system throughout the Wars of the Third and Fourth Coalitions’ campaigns are useful example to keep in mind when thinking about the utility of this concept.<sup>80</sup> See Figure 2, Risk in Proxy War.
