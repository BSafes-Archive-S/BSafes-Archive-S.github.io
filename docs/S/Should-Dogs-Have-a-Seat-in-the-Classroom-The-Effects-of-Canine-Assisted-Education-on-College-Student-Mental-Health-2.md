## Method
### Study Design 
A quasi-experimental, one-group pre-test/post-test design was used to explore the recurring effects of CAE on student anxiety and stress, distractibility, and participation over the course of 5 weeks.

### Participants
A non-probability convenience sample of occupational therapy (OT) students enrolled in the Introduction to Occupational Science course was used for this study. One therapy dog, Stella, registered with Therapy Dogs International (ID# 144787), participated in the study. Stella is a 3-year-old female Leonberger with 2 years of therapy dog experience. She has had experience engaging in therapy dog work in a variety of settings, including hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and three college campuses. The Principal Investigator (PI)/instructor for the Introduction to Occupational Science course is Stella’s handler. The study consisted of one group, an experimental group. The Northeast College’s Institutional Review Board for protection of human subjects approved this study (approval #1016-03). Students were screened for exclusion criteria, including having an allergy or fear of dogs, prior to the study. The student participants were provided the option to disclose any possible concerns with the therapy dog’s presence publicly or privately with the PI and/or graduate research assistants. All students identified as being free of allergies and stated that they did not have a fear of dogs prior to the study. The study took place in a classroom located in the Center for Health Science’s building on a campus in the Northeast. There were 27 students and one professor in a large rectangular classroom, including two sets of four rows of four tables approximately 8 feet by 3 feet allowing for up to four students to sit at each table and a center aisle in the middle. Spaces were provided between tables to allow access for Stella to walk through the classroom.

### Instrumentation
The College Student Engagement Survey was developed and used to measure students’ levels of perceived anxiety and stress, participation, and distractibility. Although there are measures that capture stress and anxiety independently, they vary in the amount of time between delivery and purpose of assessment. For example, the popular Perceived Stress scale (PSS) capturing stress over the past month, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory intended to assess anxiety in the moment as well as anxiety “proneness.” In addition, there were no instruments that included participation and distractibility measures for the college student population. Furthermore, the investigators wanted to implement a concise measure to maximize student response rates as there have been reports of increasing survey fatigue among college students (Porter et al., 2004). After initial questions were developed, three PhD educated instructors working in higher education reviewed the survey and provided feedback. The feedback was carefully reviewed and implemented prior to submitting the survey to the Institutional Review Board. The 32- question survey included nine demographic questions followed by two questions related to students’ personal class performance and learning style. In addition, the survey included 13 questions on distractibility that used a Likert scale, including 11 questions with five rankings (1 = *strongly disagree to* 5 = strongly agree) and two questions with four rankings (1 = *never to* 4 = always). The survey contained five questions regarding participation and was written in a Likert format with five rankings (1 = *strongly agree to* 5 = strongly disagree), as well as 12 questions on anxiety and stress, including 10 Likert type questions with five rankings per question (1 = never to 5 = very often). A continuous sliding scale format was used for the remaining two questions in this category that allowed the student to adjust a point on the scale from 1 = *no anxiety to* 10 = *maximum level of anxiety*, and 1 = *no stress* to 10 = *maximum level of stress*. The College Student Engagement Survey was used as both a pre-test and post-test instrument for this study. The participants completed the College Student Engagement Survey pre-test immediately before their first intervention and immediately after their last intervention.

### Procedures
In order to eliminate the possibility of coercion, the PI/instructor of the course was not present during informed consent and data collection procedures. Trained graduate student research assistants actively completed informed consent with each participant prior to participation in the study, which allowed the students to ask questions. After informed consent was completed, the students were provided the option to include or exclude their survey data in the final results to further decrease the possibility of coercion. The participants voluntarily completed the pre-test survey via QualtricsTM online at the beginning of their regularly scheduled class at the start of the 5-week period from November 1st to December 8th (Qualtrics, 2020). Any student that did not have access to a laptop or electronic device to access the survey had one provided to them.

After completion of the pre-test survey, the therapy dog, Stella, was introduced into the classroom. Stella attended each of the two scheduled 75-min classes on Tuesday and Thursday for 5 weeks from November 1st to December 8th. In order to allow the students, a majority of whom were freshman, to have a typical classroom experience for the first half of the semester, the CAE was implemented in Week 11 through Week 15 of a 15-week semester. The 11th week was approximately 3 weeks after midterm and was not considered a particularly stressful time of the semester. During the intervention, normal classroom instruction proceeded as scheduled, consisting of lectures by the professor, guest lecturers, student presentations, small group discussions, and quizzes. Stella navigated through the classroom and students throughout each class period as desired. At the end of the 5-week period, the students completed the College Student Engagement Survey for a second time to generate post-test data without the PI/instructor present. All students who completed the pre-test and post-test consented to their survey results being included in the final data analysis.

### Data Analysis
In the one-group pre—test/post-test design, the independent variable in the study was time. The dependent variables in the study were anxiety and stress, distractibility, and participation. Quantitative data from the surveys was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (Version 24.0). Responses to the College Student Engagement Survey were assigned numeric values and entered in SPSS. The research questions and data guided the analyses. In this study, a nonparametric, Wilcoxon signed-rank test was chosen. This test is equivalent to a dependent t-test; however, it does not assume normality in the distribution of the data. Furthermore, it can be used to compare two sets of scores that come from the same group of participants (Laerd Statistics, 2018). The investigators reviewed the data and excluded one participant’s data because of incompleteness. The investigators reviewed the study to ensure all assumptions were met, including the data was ordinal, the independent variable consisted of two matched pairs, and the distribution of the differences between the matched pairs were symmetrical in shape. Finally, the investigators used an alpha level of *p* < .05 as a cutoff for significance. The numeric data was then further analyzed to determine conclusions as related to the study’s research questions.
