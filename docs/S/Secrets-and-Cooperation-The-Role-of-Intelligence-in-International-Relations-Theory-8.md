## Conclusion
Realism, Classic Liberalism, and Neoliberalism provide multiple ideas and solutions to achieve security cooperation and national policy objectives through the role of intelligence. Intelligence is critical to national security objectives and cooperation because it allows decision makers such as diplomats, policy makers, or military commanders make informed decisions based on the current threat picture. It allows for partners and allies—whether interagency or multinational—to collaborate on common threats and security challenges. Neoliberalism, however, is among the most effective approaches between the three theories because of the value it places on institutions. The world in the twenty-first century is institutional already, and as such, international organizations, whether military, diplomatic, or humanitarian in nature, already operate in such a way. Intelligence among partners, through institutions and organizations, allows for these entities to operate in a more productive and situationally aware approach.

Intelligence plays a key role in the Neoliberalism IR theory because it equips those in positions of great power to anticipate rising challenges and depend on international and institutional partnerships. Nation states that are great powers are no longer able to survive or meet their national interest objectives on their own. As U.S. and NATO allies complete their military operations in Afghanistan, a new challenge becomes central. Great Power Competition poses security challenges by China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran in new domains of warfare. Accurate and credible intelligence gathering, analysis, and sharing allows for the United States become better postured to meet those threats. In addition, proper intelligence training and resources will also be central to combatting GPC. The United States and its international partners must enhance their ability to train with each other, identify intelligence gaps, and provide each other with valuable opportunities for professional military education. GPC will take place in new domains, and great powers that are in competition with the United States are not waiting to act militarily or politically to achieve their national interests. The United States cannot afford to wait either.
