## Implications for HMC and SeS
In this comparative literature review, I have conjoined two rather disconnected bodies of literature in an effort to revisit sex robots in/as human-machine sexualities. I argued that, in addition to sensory, robotic, and AI-components (Döring, 2021a), what sets sex robots apart from other sexual technologies is not so much their status as agents in sexual human-machine encounters, but rather the ways in which humans may relate with them; said differently, their capacity to create meaning with humans in human-machine sexualities, or communicative sexuotechnical-assemblages. In doing so, I respond to not only more-than-human efforts in HMC, but also to calls for fluidifying academic discourse on sexuality (Lambevski, 2004).

### Theoretical Implications
Theorizing human-machine sexualities as communicative sexuotechnical-assemblages by conjoining rather disconnected bodies of literature and theoretical perspectives responds to recent calls for transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to the study of sex robots (e.g., Döring et al., 2020; Zhou & Fischer, 2020). Collectively, these approaches allow for more nuanced perspectives of sex robots that reject both the utopian visions of unending pleasure with sex robots (Levy, 2007a; Ornella, 2009) and the dystopian fears of those who call for abolishing sex robots (Campaign Against Porn Robots, n.d.). Grounded in communication and sexuality studies, and adjacent fields, the concept of communicative sexuotechnical-assemblage adds to existing, more philosophical and ethical projects in the context of machines generally (Coeckelbergh, 2010, 2012; Gerdes, 2015; Gunkel, 2012, 2018) and of sex robots specifically (e.g., Danaher, 2017b; Ess, 2016, 2018). By examining the affective flows between humans and machines in sexual encounters, scholars can track the various ethical, legal, sociological, and communicative issues addressed in the literature and raised by sex robots. This also includes a move beyond the binary thinking in the current literature, identified by Döring et al. (2020) and already elaborated on above. In so doing, human-machine sexualities continue and extend the recent critical turn in HMC by specifically turning to sex and sexuality as ripe contexts, and SeS as rich resources for critical efforts in HMC.

For instance, drawing on critical perspectives challenges reductionistic and problematic conceptions of sex work in debates on sex robots (Kubes, 2019). Authors such as Richardson (2016a, 2016b) or Levy (2007b), among others, who compare robot sex with human sex work, tend to fall back on understandings of sex work that frame the sex worker as “objectified and instrumentalized” (Danaher, 2017b, pp. 110–111) or as “reduced to a thing” (Richardson, 2016b, p. 291, emphasis in original). Critical SeS and, in particular, Marxist feminist, Black queer, crip, trans, and trans of color approaches offer a dramatically different and resistant understanding of sex work, guided by anti-respectability politics that highlight how “community members thrive despite existing in a hostile world unconcerned with their survival” (Glover & Glover, 2019, p. 172). Moreover, Danaher (2014) offered a nuanced understanding of sex work as it relates to what he describes as technological unemployment, or the displacement of human sex workers by the advent of sophisticated sex robots. This effort continues specifically Marxist and materialist understandings that correctly frame sex work in the context of labor and market dynamics. Drawing on critical non-white, non-cisheterosexist, and non-cisheteropatriarchal accounts of sexuality therefore simultaneously resists reductionistic accounts of sex work and sexuality writ large and opens up different ways to theorize and practice sexuality—both among humans and between humans and nonhumans.

Another implication based on the critical sensibilities inherent to communicative sexuotechnical-assemblages in human-machine sexual encounters is the ongoing critique of transhumanist utopias and fantasies in relation to sex robots (e.g., Lakshmanan, 2021). Specifically from the perspective of (critical) disability studies, transhumanist desires to improve, enhance, and perfect the human body either by modifying human bodies or by replacing “deficient” and “defunct” human bodies with better, and more “perfect” machine-others must grapple with ableist discourse of “curing” and “overcoming” disability (Hauskeller, 2017). Similar dynamics between sexuality and dis/ability have been centered by scholars in a/sexuality studies (e.g., Flore, 2014; Kafer, 2013; Wilkerson, 2011); efforts that consistently critique the normative formations of a “sexual” body, a “healthy” body, and “healthy” sexuality writ large. Human-machine sexualities navigate these important critiques by disregarding any consideration of enhancing the sexual other or sexuality as such, given its focus on the flows of affect between entangled partners. Nonetheless, dynamics of enhancement of intimacy, pleasure, and desire must be thoroughly examined in the context of emerging sexual technologies, including sex robots, particularly as it relates to labor, reproduction, and dynamics of the neoliberal market (Atanasoski & Vora, 2020).

Furthermore, human-machine sexualities embrace more-than-human and geographical registers in both HMC (cf. Betlemidze, 2022; Dehnert, 2021) and SeS (Flore & Pienaar, 2020; Fox & Alldred, 2013) that fluidify (Lambevski, 2004) individualistic and humanistic understandings of the sexuo-communicative subject-object relation in human-machine sexualities. These perspectives raise questions such as, what exactly is meant by “communicative subject” in entangled and assembled human-machine interactions? Resonating with the social relational turn, this essay continues rethinking agency, interactivity, directionality of communication and desire, and more, in ecological terms of affective flows.

Additionally, this broadening of conceptualizing the (sexual) communication practices between humans and machines comes along with rethinking the role of sexuality for the human. When humans engage with sex robots in communicative sexuotechnicalassemblages via human-machine sexual encounters, “what are the boundaries around [*human*] sexuality” (Hearn, 2018, p. 1368)? Insights from asexuality studies scholars demonstrate that, through discourses, instruments, and institutions, “‘sexuality’ effectively became tied to humanity” (Flore, 2014, p. 18). As such, ongoing work by asexuality studies scholars works toward delinking the intimate, compulsory relationship between being human and being sexual by making space for alternative modes of being and doing. Offering an alternative to person-based understandings of sexuality and sexual practices, morethan-human and assemblage-approaches resist clear-cut boundaries of (human) sexuality, thereby embracing the messiness of sexuality (Manalansan, 2013), even (or particularly) in the “sterile” context of machines.

### Design Implications
Authors have predominantly critiqued representation and design of sex robots in relation to sexualized and exaggerated images of the female body or engaged in speculative musing on the ethical design of future sex robots (Döring et al., 2020). There is an insignificant integration of academic research and the design of sex robots, prompting calls for an integrated understanding of sex robots that recognizes the sociotechnical development and nature of sex robots (Danaher, 2019a). Relatedly, designers can draw from SeS by being clearer about the distinction between gender and sex in robot design. Recall that RealDoll (n.d.b) offers sex robots in “three different gender orientations: Male, female and transsexual” (p. 6). Clearly, these descriptors refer neither to *gender* nor to an *orientation*, which calls for feminist and other critical approaches to more accurately imitate sex and gender in sex robot design. Finally, shifting toward an assemblage-framework allows for broadening the design of sex robots writ large, where “the obvious question we have to ask is: why should a sex robot look like a human?” (Kubes, 2019, p. 10). Displacing concerns for human and nonhuman subjects and objects allows for broadening our understanding of what a sex robot can be and can look like. Modeling sex robots after different fantasies than the male gaze so prevalent in pornographic and other representational accounts is one way to navigate the expectations surrounding humanoid robots (Danaher, 2019a).

### Implications for the Use and Effects of Sex Robots
Reviewers (Döring et al., 2020; González-González et al., 2021) have identified a significant lack of empirical research conducted on actual use patterns and contexts as well as user behavior, leaving most claims about effects squarely within philosophical, ethical, and speculative realms (see Harper & Lievesley, 2020). Nonetheless, the assemblage-perspective put forth in this essay allows at least for comments on rough implications regarding the therapeutic use of sex robots and child robots, one of the most controversial components of an already highly controversial topic (e.g., Chatterjee, 2020). Critical communication and SeS perspectives call for a nuanced understanding of “therapeutic,” paying particular attention to undergirding systems of belief that target a/sexual, disabled, and nonnormative others in particular ways (Kafer, 2013; Wilkerson, 2011). Conjoining disability, SeS, and queer perspectives, the therapeutic use of sex robots must always be understood in the context of larger systems of meaning—which is reflected in the territorializingdeterritorializing-reterritorializing dynamics of the sexuality-assemblage (Fox & Alldred, 2013). That is, any calls for therapeutic use of sex robots must be critiqued: Therapy for whom, why, in what ways, and based on what grounds? Similarly, the case of child sex robots must be evaluated in the sociocultural context (Danaher, 2019b). Clearly, these debates are far from settled and require thorough, interdisciplinary contributions from academics, designers/manufacturers, and the general public.
