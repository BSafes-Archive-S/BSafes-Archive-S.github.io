## Discussion
Although there is research present on the lives and adaptations to prison of individuals with schizophrenia, researchers still have limited data and studies, along with certain aspects limiting the sample. While the socioeconomic status and lack of education of the arrestees made one population sample accessible, the sample is still limiting in that regard. Author Ramsey had noted that while rates of incarceration are high, the sample consisted solely of young, African American males, many of whom were highschool dropouts, which increased their risk of arrest (2011). Another problem with accessibility occurs when the prisoner is a paranoid schizophrenic. This could result in the subject (the prisoner) refusing to participate in studies or refusing to cooperate at times, making data collection all but impossible.
