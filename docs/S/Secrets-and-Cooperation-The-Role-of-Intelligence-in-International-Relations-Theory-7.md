## Great Power Competition
How then is IR theory, Neoliberalism specifically, harnessed in the age of Great Power Competition with powers such as China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran? Neoliberalism, without a doubt, will play a key role by encouraging existing partnerships and alliances to become more engaged with each other and for new partnerships to be created. Military cooperation will not be the sole focus area, but also economic, social, and diplomatic cooperation. It is thus critical for modern defense strategists to understand that GPC will be unlike anything the United States has ever faced in the past. “The return of great power competition does not necessarily mean a return to large-scale conventional operations. In fact, the forms of conflict with other great powers that are most likely to emerge in the near future will not resemble the major combat engagements of the Cold War” (Erickson, 2021). These conflicts will be low intensity, falling below the threshold of armed conflict. Russia, for example, may continue to use its proxies to engage in cyber warfare, election interference, or sow social unrest in regions like Eastern Europe.

A key nuance of GPC is the desire and ability of adversaries to exploit numerous vulnerabilities and weaknesses of Western powers. “Great power competition means U.S. adversaries are deploying capabilities across continents and in every domain to challenge the United States and its interests” (Harrington & McCabe, 2021). The cyber domain along with the space domain will become more prominent in the years to come, and the land domain, while being the largest and most common, will become less so. Harrington and McCabe wrote that the military needs to closely coordinate its efforts with the IC to properly address the security challenges faced by the United States, especially in fighting domains where there exists a lack of attention, resources, and capabilities. The United States must not only identify areas of vulnerability in its defense infrastructure but also work to secure and improve such areas.

Neoliberalism advocates for the role of institutions to achieve national policy objectives. As such, military, diplomatic, and political intuitions must remain aware, through active intelligence gathering and analysis, of the global threat picture. Military organizations such as NATO must be equipped with the latest and most dependable intel collection assets and capabilities, along with rigorous and continuous training requirements. Intel sharing among NATO partners needs to occur on a regular basis via several methods, being engagements, exercises, or exchanges. Foreign disclosure officers will play an increasingly significant role in vetting intelligence products to international partners in accordance with federal law. Intel sharing partnerships such as the FVEYs may require additional funding and resources to complete their missions. These multinational partnerships are now considered to be “the norm, making intelligence sharing with interagency and multinational partners increasingly important” (JP 2-01). This important work must continue. Strategic allies are a critical component of the United States’ national defense strategy, and given the nature of current strategic threats, the allies’ role in multinational cooperation will become even more vital.
