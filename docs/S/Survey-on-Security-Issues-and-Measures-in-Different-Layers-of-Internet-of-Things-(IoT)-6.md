## 6. Conclusion 
In this paper, the survey is based on the application areas of IoT where IoT plays an important role but still needs more research work in different fields. The scope of the study is to make life of the disabled and old age people easier and comfortable by providing best possible services to its users by communicating the embedded devices with remote objects or people through internet. The other future aspect of the study is to maintain privacy, data protection, authentication and security of the user which will became the challenge to the future trends.
