## The Transactional Model—The Business Deal Amongst Strategic Actors
The transactional model is the most challenging to comprehend because it is often misconstrued as either a coalition, an alliance, or a partnership. The transaction model roughly equates to a business deal amongst strategic actors. The character of the transactional model of relationship within proxy war is long understood. To be sure, theorist Carl von Clausewitz commented on this idea in his classic treatise On War. Clausewitz writes that:

But even when both states are in earnest about making war upon the third, they do not always say, “we must treat this country as our common enemy and destroy it, or we shall be destroyed ourselves.” Far from it: The affair is more often like a business deal.<sup>69</sup>

The mutual exchange of services and goods, which provides reciprocated benefit for the principal and proxy, is the transactional model’s harmonizing feature. This model is unique because political negotiation amongst strategic actors drives the arrangement of the principal-proxy dyad from the strategic to tactical levels. In this model, mutual interest often brings strategic actors together. However, the deliberation on how to achieve their mutual interest impacts how and who becomes the principal and the proxy at the levels of war. In most instances, the stronger of the two actors tends to fill the principal vacancies, whereas the weaker actor serves as the proxy. The recent campaign to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq serves as a useful example to explain the transactional model. In 2014 the government of Iraq sought international help from the United States, among others, to combat ISIS.<sup>70</sup> Politically, both the United States and government of Iraq set the war’s major policy objectives. Strategically and operationally, however, the government of Iraq and the Iraqi military set the military objectives but were supported and advised by the United States and its coalition partners. At the tactical level, American forces fought a proxy campaign against the Islamic State through Iraqi regular and irregular forces.

As the name implies, this model is based on a transactional relationship between actors. This results in a relationship that has a fixed duration, and the life expectancy of a transactional relationship begins to erode once the first shots in combat are fired. Subsequently, the proxy’s interest in the principal recedes at a comparable rate to the accomplishment of the two actor’s common interest. Harkening back to the Iraq example, one finds that the United States began to rapidly lose influence with the government of Iraq and Iraqi military following victory at Mosul in July 2017 and Tal A’far in August 2017.<sup>71</sup> There was no bigger signal of this divergence and loss of influence than Iraq’s campaign to stymy Kurdish independence in October 2017, which was conducted against the recommendations or support United States.<sup>72</sup> Moreover, Prime Minister Haider Abadi’s calls for the redeployment of American troops in the wake of the government of Iraqi’s declaration of victory against ISIS in December 2017 further illustrates this concept.<sup>73</sup>

As the U.S.-Iraq example suggests, the transactional model sees the proxy force’s government request support from other strategic actor(s) to defeat a threat. In doing so, the proxy force’s government places parameters on the principal and on the duration of the mission. The proxy government issues parameters to align the principal with its own political and military objectives. It is also important to note that the proxy has fixed political and social interest in the principal, therefore it attempts to terminate the partnership upon attainment of its goals.

Proto-states or polities vying for legitimacy appear on the other side of the transactional proxy spectrum. Harkening back to the Cossacks and the Great Northern War’s battle of Poltava, both Sweden and Russia offered varying degrees of support to the Cossack Hetmanate in exchange for assistance battling the other.<sup>74</sup> Sweden mustered approximately 5,000 Cossack proxies for the battle, while Russia drew support from around 15,000 Cossacks.<sup>75</sup> Each Cossack group made different deals with their respective principal, but once the Tsardom of Muscovy achieved victory over Sweden, the Tsardom severely curtailed the rights and independence of all Cossacks within its realm.<sup>76</sup> Similar to the previous example, this version of the transactional relationship is also a business deal with the relationship metered against a running clock. This variation differs from the previous example in that the principal is solely in the lead, whereas in the first variation, the proxy has much more power.The transactional model is fraught with potential danger for the principal because the agent is not entirely dependent on the principal, making it susceptible to external influence. The proxy’s comment to the principal and their common interest is tied to self-interest and not necessarily survival, opening it up to break its pact with the principal when it no longer profits from the relationship or finds danger in the relationship.
