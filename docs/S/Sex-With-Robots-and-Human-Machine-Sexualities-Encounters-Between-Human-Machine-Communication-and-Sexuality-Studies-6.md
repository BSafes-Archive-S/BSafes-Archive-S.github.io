## Author Biography
**Marco Dehnert** (MA, Arizona State University) is a doctoral student in the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication at Arizona State University. His research interests focus on critical/cultural approaches to communication and rhetorical studies. With a broad focus on how one recognizes and disavows the Other, his work is situated at the intersections of critical and intersectional rhetorics, queer and transgender communication studies, qualitative inquiry, and human-machine communication.
