## Results
Data collected during the implementation of the study were analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. First, demographic data will be presented, followed by the results of the analyses of the specific research questions.

### Demographics
The study’s population consisted of 26 college student participants. Specific demographics are provided in Table 1. The students in this study were OT students that were accepted into the OT program during the admissions process to college. This Northeast University offers a unique combined Bachelor of Science/Master of Science 5-year program that allows direct admissions to the graduate program with no separate application process.

### Anxiety and Stress, Distractibility, and Participation
Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in this study, the investigators intended to determine if there are statistically significant findings between CAE on college students’ anxiety and stress, distractibility, and participation of one group’s pre-test and post-test scores (Laerd Statistics, 2018). The researchers hypothesized participants would demonstrate a significant decrease in anxiety and stress on the post-test survey compared to the pre-test survey. This hypothesis was accepted (*p* = 0.033; see Table 2). Next, the researchers hypothesized college student participants would not demonstrate increased distractibility on the post-test survey compared to the pre-test survey, as this might indicate students were distracted by the therapy dog’s presence in the classroom. This hypothesis was not accepted (*p* = 0.295). Although the participants did not show statistically significant decreases in distractibility, the hypothesis aimed to determine if increases in distractibility existed, and the analysis showed the distractibility mean decreased from 36.92 to 35.73 with sums decreasing from 960 to 929. Finally, the researchers hypothesized college student participants would demonstrate a significant increase in reported participation in class activities on the post-test survey compared to the pre-test survey. This hypothesis was accepted (*p* = 0.009). These results divulge further insight into the profound impacts of recurring CAE on college students.

This study demonstrates recurring CAE, over a 5-week period, in college students’ natural environment, a college classroom, has a positive impact on students’ anxiety and stress. Most notably, 69% of the student participants noted a decrease in perceived anxiety and stress with 42% of the participants reporting the presence of a dog to *always* decrease anxiety and stress and 27% of the students noting a decrease in anxiety and *stress most of the time*. Furthermore, 78% of the students reported interaction with the dog to reduce anxiety and stress with a greater reduction noted with direct interaction (see Figure 2). This can be defined as interactions such as physically touching the dog via petting, sitting with the dog, or 1:1 engagement through play.

*Note.* Participants’ pretest and posttest responses regarding the perceptions of the effect of the presence and/or interaction with a therapy dog.
