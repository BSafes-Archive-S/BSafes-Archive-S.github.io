## A New Era for Competition
Now that U.S. and coalition forces have completed their withdrawal out of Afghanistan, and the Global War on Terror has ended, the Department of Defense (DOD) and IC now shift their focus from counterterrorism to GPC, and more importantly, large scale combat operations. Although ground forces may not be as widely used in GPC, it should be expected that cyber, artificial intelligence, and even space-centric technologies be used both by the United States and its allies, along with adversaries. The threats to the United States, therefore, are becoming more nuanced and potentially more lethal. The COVID-19 global pandemic did not pause or delay nefarious actors from plotting acts of terrorism, destruction, or harm to the United States. The 2021 Annual Threat Assessment from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) warned that, “Beijing, Moscow, Tehran, and Pyongyang have demonstrated the capability and intent to advance their interests at the expense of the United States and its allies, despite the pandemic” (Office of the Director of Natonal Intelligence, 2021, p. 4). Keeping these realities in mind, a study into the role of intelligence in IR theory–and subsequently any policy that results from it–is a good starting point.
