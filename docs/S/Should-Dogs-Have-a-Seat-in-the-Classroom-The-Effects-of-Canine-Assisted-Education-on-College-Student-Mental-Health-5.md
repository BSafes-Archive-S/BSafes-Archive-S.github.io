## Conclusion
The findings of this study have implications for understanding the effects of therapy dogs on participants’ academic role as a college student through presenting statistically significant results in anxiety, stress, and participation as well as demonstrating therapy dogs are not perceived as a distractor in the classroom. The study’s results aligned with those of researchers that explored similar variables in this population and added to the body of research demonstrating positive effects with a recurring CAE. Future studies should focus on using rigorous instruments as well as reaching a larger body of students, including those in graduate and professional fields. The PEO model is an appropriate framework to further explore the fit between the person (college student), environment (college classroom), and occupation (education). The results of this study demonstrate significant potential for the inclusion of a low-cost intervention of CAE on college campuses to reduce growing mental health concerns in this population.
