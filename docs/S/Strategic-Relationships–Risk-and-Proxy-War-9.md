## Conclusion
Proxy war’s frequency and pervasiveness in modern armed conflict reveals its political and strategic viability. While insurgencies or partisan wars are motivated by individual political interest, today’s proxy wars are an expression of great power competition. Resultantly, the insurgent or partisan is important to understand in small wars, but not so in proxy wars. An appreciation for what fixes partners in a principal-agent relationship is the important thing to understand about proxy wars. The bonding amongst partners is germane because it is the catalyst and the lubricant within the engine of proxy war.

Two variables are critical to account for when analyzing proxy relationships. The first is agency, or which partner owns the problem. Second, and more important, is risk-sharing. Risk-sharing, from a broader perspective, is the defining variable in principal-proxy relationships because it serves as the adhesive between two cooperating parties. In most cases risk-sharing is what determines the duration of any principal-agent relationship and the tight or looseness of the bond between partners.

Analyzing risk as it relates to a principal and its agent is central to understanding proxy relationships. This analysis provides the framework for strategists, planners, and leaders to either defeat a principal-proxy on the battlefield or protect one’s own principal-agent relationship. Theorist Thomas Schelling provides useful counsel on risk when thinking about risk-sharing in proxy relationships. He posits that, “The questions that do arise involve degrees of risk—what risk is worth taking, and how to evaluate risk involved in a course of action…It adds an entire dimension to military relations: the manipulation of risk.”<sup>81</sup> Schelling’s proposition, when viewed in relation to the bond between principals and proxies results in the acknowledgement that risk is a wedge issue between actors. This, in essence, results in the five models of relationship in proxy war— exploitative, coercive, cultural, contractual, or transactional.

Exploited proxy relationships are short but the bond amongst actors is strong. Coerced proxy relationships result in weak bonds between partners and the proxy’s commitment is causally linked to the principal’s physical presence as an occupying force. Cultural proxy relationships are extremely strong and the duration prodigious because of the stalwart cultural bond between principal and agent. Contractual proxy relationships, on the other hand, are firm because of the inspiration provided by the profit motive. Moreover, the contractual proxy knowingly accepts the strategic and tactical risk before entering a principal-agent relationship. This results in a tight tactical bond, but that bond loosens at the strategic level. The relationship tethers because a principal will divorce itself from its contractual proxy if that proxy jeopardizes its (the principal’s) strategic aims. Conversely, the contractual proxy will craft an exit plan if it approaches existential crisis. Importantly, contractual proxyism dominates today’s proxy wars. As analyst Sean McFate notes, private military companies and mercenaries operate globally and transparent to the public.<sup>82</sup> As long as this continues, contractual proxies will continue to loom large in proxy war.<sup>83</sup> Furthermore, as war pushes further into the Grey Zone via hybrid means, the demand for contractual agents will increase. Lastly, transactional proxy relationship is akin to a business deal and they last as long as their mutual interests serve both actors. Resultantly, the bond between the actors in a transactional proxy relationship is weak and unravels upon completion of the unifying strategic aims.

Proxy war is here to stay. Proxy wars will continue to dominate armed conflict so long as nuclear weapons cast a long shadow over great power and medium power conflict. Additionally, proxy war will continue to dominate armed conflict so long as governments are interested in decreasing their political risks associated with war. Proxy wars abstruse involvement in war by deferring the cost to surrogates, who do the fighting and dying for a thankless and unknowing public far away from the battlefield. This arrangement makes war a more pervasive tool for policy makers and strategists.
