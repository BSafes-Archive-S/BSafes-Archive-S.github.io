## Sex Robots: A Controversial Technology and/in HMC
Sex robots are a controversial and highly debated topic in lay and academic circles, including but not limited to legal, ethical, design, feminist, clinical, therapeutic, and other perspectives (for a review, see Döring et al., 2020). After conducting their review of interdisciplinary literature focused on sex dolls and sex robots, Döring et al. (2020) conclude that

> Predictions of small and/or ambivalent effects might be more realistic [than the dystopian or utopian visions so prevalent in the literature] but are seldom discussed in the academic literature thus far, which seems to mirror some of the hype and scandalization observable in public media discourses. (p. 21)

As one potential explanation for these dramatized perspectives, Döring and colleagues name the fact that many people do not have firsthand experiences with sex robots due to their scarcity and cost. Some scholars project, however, that people will gain significantly more experience with sex bots and, in 2050, it will be not only common for folks to experience sex and love with machines (Levy, 2007a), but that humans might actually have more sex with robots than with other humans (Pearson, 2015; see Hauskeller, 2017, for an important critique of such transhumanist visions). In light of these rather bold projections, it is necessary to further our understanding of human-machine sexualities.

Technology and sexuality have been embraced by many scholars, given the myriad ways in which technology—broadly understood as biomedical, biomechanical, and biodigital—is related to sexuality. Scholars have written on technologies in the realm of the sexual, such as pharmaceuticals (Flore, 2018), technology in pornography (Dekker et al., 2021), and sex robots. In the literature on sex technologies, and also in public perception, sex toys emerge as one of the more prominent technologies. Understood as “material objects selected, created, and used to generate or enhance sexual arousal and pleasure in both solo and partnered sex” (Döring, 2021b, p. 1), sex toys include both commercially produced and homemade objects such as vibrators or masturbators. Recent models including wireless sex toys or otherwise digitized and connected sex toys have been the focal point of scholars and designers, usually labeled teledildonics (Flore & Pienaar, 2020). These technologies are marketed as sensory devices that allow for haptic or kinaesthetic interaction between partners across distance, or with the technology that responds to movement and touch. Typically paired with smartphone applications (apps), these devices allow for personalization and recording of personal preferences, promising “to increase sexual performance and pleasure through the algorithmic analysis of data” (Flore & Pienaar, 2020, p. 280). However, critics note that teledildonics reintroduce well-discussed issues regarding sexual safety and normativity. For instance, Sparrow and Karas (2020) argue that teledildonics allow for “rape by deception,” or the risk of being deceived about the sexual partner’s features and/or about which person the user was having “sex” with. Thus, while teledildonics promise increased sexual pleasure and intimacy, these connected technologies raise intriguing questions about intimacy, sexual practices, and human interaction.

But what distinguishes a sex robot from a sex doll, a teledildonics device, or any other sex toy? Cognizant of Fortunati and Edwards’s (2021) insight that “Robots have such a multiform and mutant body that it becomes difficult to talk of robots’ identity as well as of robots’ capabilities” in a general sense (p. 16), and aware of the rapid technological advances in the fields of robotics and AI, any attempt at defining sex robots must inevitably be incomplete and tentative. Moreover, definitions and designs vary, particularly regarding the role and prominence of AI and other robotic features of sex robots. This also includes differences in the level of sophistication as it relates to the AI personalities being sold to customers across various models. Current technology is rather rudimentary (Döring et al., 2020); however, sex robots currently on the market should not be confused with advanced machines depicted in science fiction, which are oftentimes imagined having sentience, consciousness, free will, and the like. In a recent attempt at defining sex robots, Döring (2021a) offers “human-like, full-body, anatomically correct, humanoid service robots of different materials, technologies, and price ranges that are designed and used to generate or enhance sexual arousal and pleasure in both solo and partnered sex” (p. 1). What sets sex robots apart from sex dolls, then, is that they are “equipped with sensors, actuators, and artificial intelligence” (p. 1)—in short, some sort of automated or mechanical technological features that allow the sex robot to move, talk, or otherwise interact with the human user.

In the case of the aforementioned Abyss Creations’ RealDoll, for instance, customers can purchase AI-enhanced, robotic heads that can be added to sex dolls. Users can customize their sex dolls/robots in many ways, including body shape, skin tone, eye color, make-up, face, hair, and more. The AI-enhanced head allows for users to engage with their sex robot in various ways, including conversation, and the robotic head includes features such as eye movement, facial expression, as well as neck and mouth movement. With the accompanying app, users can fully customize their sex robot’s personality, allowing the AI to learn the user’s interests and preferences. RealDoll’s dolls and robots are available as male, female, and transsexual models. Users can even purchase Bluetooth-enabled haptic vaginal sensors for the dolls which “can detect touch, movement, and transitions from mild arousal to orgasm” (RealDoll, n.d.a). In short, most contemporary sex robots are sex dolls enhanced with very limited AI and robotic features, oftentimes limited to specific body parts (head, vaginal sensors), and with limited interactive capabilities (conversation, eye movement, haptic feedback). Nonetheless, compared to sex dolls, these more interactive technological capabilities of sex robots are imagined leading to potentially rich relationships and shared, communicatively constructed meaning, where expected capabilities of sex robots involve hearing, recognizing objects, talking, or even taking initiative, among others (Scheutz & Arnold, 2016). The current sex robot market is advancing rapidly—as is the technology—but difficult to review, not least given the vast social stigma associated with this technology and its users. It is important to note that relations with each product differ, given variance in robotic capabilities, AI affordances, levels of sophistication, and user characteristics.

Notwithstanding these rather limited robotic and interactive functions of contemporary sex robots, scholars have expressed a variety of concerns and hopes in relation to sex robots (for reviews, see Döring et al., 2020; González-González et al., 2021). Although sparked by transhumanist researchers like Levy (2007a), the debate on sex robots has broadly considered domestic, commercial, and therapeutic use of sex robots (Döring et al., 2020). As such, target audiences and potential uses of sex robots vary, which shapes the production and design of sex robots (see Harper & Lievesley, 2020). These debates are additionally complicated by the “purely speculative” nature of claims about current and future effects as well as potential benefits and harms of sex robots and the scarcity of empirical studies thus far (Döring et al., 2020, p. 2). In addition to several edited collections (e.g., Bendel, 2020; Cheok et al., 2016; Cheok & Zhang, 2019; Danaher & McArthur, 2017; Zhou & Fischer, 2019) and monographs (e.g., Levy, 2007a), scholars have written about sex robots related to their conceptualization and theory (e.g., Danaher, 2017a); engaged in legal and ethical considerations related to rape (e.g., Sparrow, 2017) or child robots (e.g., Chatterjee, 2020); investigated humans’ perceptions of and attitudes toward sex robots (e.g., Middleweek, 2021; Scheutz & Arnold, 2016, 2017); examined potential therapeutic use of sex robots including health implications (Cox-George & Bewley, 2018) or potential use of sex robots for persons with disabilities (e.g., Fosch-Villaronga & Poulsen, 2021); critiqued sex robot representation in art and media (for a review see Döring & Poeschl, 2019); and have considered design questions (e.g., Danaher, 2019a).

Interestingly, Döring et al. (2020) did not report studies on sex robots conducted from a communication studies perspective, highlighting the need for communication scholars to contribute to this broad context and diverse literature. That is, with their focus on how meaning is created in human-machine interactions, HMC scholars can provide unique and novel insights into the characterization and understanding of sex robots. Thus, theorizing within HMC suggests an alternative perspective to what sets sex robots apart from adjacent technologies such as sex dolls, teledildonics, and other sex toys. In fact, as Döring et al. (2020) report, the current sex robot literature “often falls back on binary thinking” when it comes to conceptualizing sex robots:

> It categorizes the current sex robot as an inanimate object and mere masturbation aid without any sociability and is only willing to ascribe sociability to future imagined sex robots that are advanced to the point of indistinguishability from humans. Hence, the literature on sex robots often misses the key point that robots are more than mere masturbation aids due to anthropomorphization and that they are meaningful and possibly helpful precisely because they are not substitutes for real humans but are sociotechnical entities for parasocial use and play. (p. 20)

HMC has a lot to contribute in response to this diagnosis, given the ongoing theorizing of human-machine relationships with a focus on meaning-making in the field. Moreover, ongoing scholarly efforts in the CASA/MASA paradigms as well as ontologizing efforts (Edwards, 2018; Guzman, 2020) within HMC offer ample opportunities to contribute to research and theory of sex robots. In fact, recent efforts for a critical turn in HMC (Fortunati & Edwards, 2021) and posthuman perspectives (e.g., Betlemidze, 2022; Dehnert, 2021) provide useful theoretical backdrops for exploring sex robots and how human-machine sexualities alter our understanding of humans, machines, and sexualities. In the next section, I elaborate how these perspectives support understanding human-machine sexualities as communicative sexuotechnical-assemblages.
