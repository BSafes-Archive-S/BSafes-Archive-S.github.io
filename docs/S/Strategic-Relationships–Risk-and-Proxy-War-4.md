## The Coercive Model—Impressment of Unwilling Contributors
The coercive model is centered on the impressment of unwilling or reluctant contributors. In this model the proxy is a pre-existing environmental actor that is coerced into a principal-agent relationship with a strong actor. The impressed or coerced proxy possesses a low willingness to shoulder the risk that comes with being a proxy, and therefore, the relationship’s bond is loose. To be sure, it is often only the principal’s physical presence that keeps the coerced proxy working on behalf of the principal. In turn, the proxy is given a minimal autonomy and the principal often micro-manages the proxy because of the lose bond between the two.

Coerced proxy relationships are often fraught with internal danger for the principal and the proxy. The proxy is subject to harsh punishment by the principal, while the principal must worry about inside attacks by the proxy. Resultantly, a principal must often employ internal security forces while working with and alongside a coerced proxy. The American employment of security forces to protect itself from its Afghan proxies in Afghanistan is one example of this idea. <sup>31</sup>

The coerced proxy is often the byproduct of a situation in which a principal has come into an area and defeated the existing ruling body and its security forces. Following that defeat, the principal coopts trusted elements from the defeated regime’s security forces. The proxy, either indifferent to the occupying power, or concerned about the effect of cooperating with the principal, displays little motivation for working with the occupier and displays limited capability, whether that be in the form of governance or security.

Germany’s use of Soviet proxies on the Eastern Front of World War II is an informative example of a coerced proxy. Shortly after the halcyon days of 1939-1941, Nazi Germany found itself bogged down in the Soviet Union and facing manpower shortages as it extended beyond its operational reach.<sup>32</sup> Historian Robert Citino notes, “It was in southern Russia that *Bewegungskrieg* ground to a halt, giving way to the very type of war that the German Army had historically tried to avoid: Stellungskrieg…After their promising starts, the German offensives of 1942 would give birth to twins: Stalingrad and El Alamein.”<sup>33</sup>

In light of this snowballing calamity, the Wehrmacht began to press Soviets into service along the Eastern Front; hilfswillige, or hiwi, is the term that became associated with these surrogates.<sup>34</sup> Historian Antony Beevor contends that while a small number of hiwis were willing participants, most, especially by the time of the battle of Stalingrad, were Soviet prisoners of war coerced into service by the Wehrmacht.<sup>35</sup> Germany’s Sixth Army, its primary warfighting formation at the battle of Stalingrad, had 50,000 Russian proxies aligned with its front-line divisions.<sup>36</sup> This number roughly equated to twenty-five percent of Germany’s total force in Stalingrad.<sup>37</sup> After the Soviet victory at Stalingrad, the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, or NKVD, imprisoned or killed most of the hiwis that it was able to identify.<sup>38</sup>

Although not to suggest parallels between Nazi Germany’s proxy strategy in World War II with American proxy strategy in the post-September 11, 2001 strategic security space, the United States’ relationship with the government of Afghanistan and the Afghan security forces is a contemporary instance of the coerced proxy model. Following the Taliban’s initial defeat in Afghanistan in late 2001 and early 2002, U.S. forces created the Afghan army and its security apparatus from scratch.<sup>39</sup> In this relationship the United States is the principal actor, and the Afghans are the coerced proxy. Together both parties combat the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and many other splinter groups and non-strategic actors that have materialized during twenty years of war.

Yet the Afghans are a coerced partner, forced to both work with the United States military (and its NATO partners) and to combat the Taliban and other security threats. Due to the lack of buy-in, Afghan security forces are often reluctant to work with U.S. forces and, despite nineteen years of focus on building Afghan capacity, Afghan forces demonstrate limited combat capability. The Afghan’s disinterest in risk sharing and lack of agency resulted in the Taliban re-taking many parts of the country. The Taliban argue that they control 70 percent of Afghanistan. <sup>40</sup> On the other end of the spectrum, one reputable report contends that the government of Afghanistan controls 54 percent of the country, while the Taliban controls 13 percent, and the remaining 33 percent of the country is actively contested between those two warring parties. <sup>41</sup> The Afghan government and its security force’s inability and unwillingness to eliminate the Taliban—a true existential threat to both those institutions—despite almost two decades of train, advise, and assist support from the United States and NATO strongly points to the coerced character between the Afghans and the United States. Furthermore, the significant number of insider attacks levied by the Afghans against American forces in Afghanistan points to the relationship’s friction brought about by its coerced bond. <sup>42</sup>

Beyond Afghanistan, analyst Jack Watling propounds that several groups in Syria also fall into the coerced proxy category. Watling notes that many Islamic rebel groups fighting against the Al-Assad regime have consumed fledgling, non-Islamic rebel groups of the Free Syrian Army and pressed them into service.<sup>43</sup> As the fighting in Syria has worn non-Islamic rebel groups down, the stronger, more powerful Islamic rebel groups have coerced the weaker groups to join forces with them against President Bashar al-Assad.<sup>44</sup>

Power is the driving force that binds the principal and proxy in a coerced relationship. Power binds the dyad because the bond between the principal and proxy, based on the proxy’s willingness to share risk and assume agency, is so feeble. <sup>45</sup> The principal’s ability to make the proxy do something it would not otherwise do, such as Soviets fighting under the swastika against the Soviet Union, or Afghan soldiers fighting the Taliban on behalf of the United States, clearly demonstrates power’s efficacy in the coerced model.<sup>46</sup>
